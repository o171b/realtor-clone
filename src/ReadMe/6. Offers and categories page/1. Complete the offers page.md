In this section we're going to work on the offers page, we go to the offers page, as we can see we've already created the route , so now we need to fetch the data for the offers, this is similar with `Home.js` but in the home page we're displaying the first four, in the offers page we'll request for more listings like 8 and then we'll have a button called `load more` and when we click on it we can see another four and so on.

a. lets first add the useEffect hook, so we to to `Offers.jsx` , by now the code should look familiar, so here it is 

```
{
export default function Offers() {

  const [listings, setListings] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(null);

  useEffect(()=>{
    const fetchListings = async ()=>{
      try {
        const listingRef = collection(db, "listings")
        const q = query(listingRef, where("offer", "==", true) ,orderBy
        ("timestamp", "desc"), limit(8));
        const querySnap = await getDoc(q)
        const listings = [];
        querySnap.forEach((doc) => {
          return listings.push({
            id: doc.id,
            data: doc.data(),
          });
        });
        setListings(listings);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error("Could not fetch listing")
      }
    } 
    fetchListings()
  },[])
}
```

b. Then in the return statement we'll return a <div> and inside it a <h1> with the text `Offers` and then we say 
if ? the loading is true then show the spinner and we're going to import the `Spinner` component , : otherwise if listings exists and && listings.length is greater than 0 then we wanna return emtpy react fragments and again we say otherwise : and we return a <p> and say There are no current offers.

inside the empty fragments <> </> we say

```
{
     <main>
          <ul>
            {listings.map((listing)=>(
              <ListingItem 
                key={listing.id}
                id={listing.id}
                listing={listing.data}
              />
            ))}
          </ul>
        </main>
        </>
}
```

c. now we're going to add the button for `load more` to fetch more listings from the database. so we'll add a piece of state to check to check if we reached the last listing so after the loading state we say `const [lastFetchedListing, setLastFetchedListing] = useState(null)` . Then inside the `useEffect` where we're getting the query `const querySnap` we can save the last visible listing. so after `const querySnap` we create a variable `const lastVisible = query` = and this is going to be equal to querySnap.docs[querySnap.docs.length -1] so inside it we get the last one and we minus it to 1 as indexes start from 0 . just imagine this one as an array thats why the [] . now that we have the last visible we can set it to the state that we created `setLastFetchedListing(lastVisible)`

d. for the `load more` button after the <main> we'll have a condition if the lastFetchedListing exists then && we wanna have the button so we create a <div> and inside it a <button> and it says load more we add some tailwind to the div and the button and then for the button we'll add a function which gets triggered when clicked, and its gonna be <button onClick={onFetchMoreListings}> and we're gonna create this async function on the top under the useEffect and inside its body we'll copy and paste the try and catch block of the useEffect.

```
{
    const onFetchMoreListings = async () => {
    try {
      const listingRef = collection(db, "listings");
      const q = query(
        listingRef,
        where("offer", "==", true),
        orderBy("timestamp", "desc"),
        startAfter(lastFetchedListing),
        limit(4)
      );
      const querySnap = await getDocs(q);
      const lastVisible = querySnap.docs[querySnap.docs.length - 1];
      setLastFetchListing(lastVisible);
      const listings = [];
      querySnap.forEach((doc) => {
        return listings.push({
          id: doc.id,
          data: doc.data(),
        });
      });
      setListings((prevState)=>[...prevState, ...listings]);
      setLoading(false);
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error("Could not fetch listing");
    }
  }
}
```
we make some changings, limitation will be 4 instead of 8  and after orderBy we use the `startAfter(lastFetchedListing)` method from firebase which is going to start form the last fetched listing so whatever the last fetched listing is we gonna start fetching after that. and in the setListings instead of getting all the listings we wanna get the `prevState` then we wanna return an array `[...prevState, ...listings]` and then we wanna add the the new listings that starts from the last fetched.
