on the home page there are links `show more places for rent` and `show more places for sale` but when we click on them, we get redirected but the page is empty, so we'll work on that.
This is very similar to the offers page so we're gonna use the same code from offers and do a lil bit of modification. 

a. in the `pages` folder we're gonna create `Category.jsx` and we're gonna `rfc` into it.

b. Inside the `App.jsx` we can create the `Route` similar to the `Offers` `<Route path='/category/:categoryName' element={<Category />} />` :categoryName can either be rent or sale so its dynamic. Now if we go to `http://localhost:5173/category/sale/` or `http://localhost:5173/category/rent/` we should be redirected to category page.

c. we're going to copy everything inside `Offers.jsx` to `Category.jsx` and make some modifications
we change the component name to `export default function Category` . in the line where it says `where ("offer" , "==", true)` we change it to type either sale or rent so we can get this information from the url which can be either sale or rent. In order to do that we use `useParams` `const params = useParams()` and then we say `where("type", "==", params.categoryName)`

d. in the function `onFetchMoreListings` we also need to modify some things, `where ("type", "==", params.categoryName)`

e. in the useEffect dependencies array we add this `[params.categoryName]`

f. instead of text in h1 that says offer , we wanna make it dynamic which either says places of sale or it says places for rent. `{params.categoryName === "rent" ? "Places for rent" : "Places for sale"}`

g. for the line that says `there are no current offers` we will make it dynamic `<p>There are no current {params.categoryName === "rent" ? "places for rent" : "places for sale"}</p>`
