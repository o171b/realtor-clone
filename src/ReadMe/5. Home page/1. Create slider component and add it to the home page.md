import { collection, getDocs, limit, orderBy, query } from "firebase/firestore";
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { db } from '../firebase';
import Spinner from '../components/Spinner';

a. In the homepage we've a slider at the top , then we have 4 listings from the `Recent Offers` , 4 listings from `places for rent` and 4 listings from `places for sale` . which means we need to create around 16 or 18 listings 5+ listings for each section so that we can have them displayed.
For the homepage slider when we click on an image it should redirect us to that particular listing. I wanna add a component called `Slider` and add that component to `Home.jsx` instead of directly coding everything inside the `Home.jsx` .

b. We go to `Slider.jsx` which is completely empty now we're going to add a `Slider` component. Inside the `components` folder im going to create a new component and call it `Slider.jsx` and then we'll go to our `Home.jsx` and import it and put it inside the <div> after the return statement. Now if we go to `Home` page we can see its written `Slider` which means it has been successfully imported.

c. The things we wanna do is to create a `useEffect` hook to get the listing data of the first five listings and the first image of the listing from our `firebase` database. so we make the useEffect hook and it'll have a function and we'll call it `fetchListings` as we'll be fetching 5 listings and after the function body we'll call this function and we'll make sure that it is `async`. First thing we'll add a `reference` which is the address of that place inside the database, we wanna get the data from the `collection` called `listings` , so we're going to create a reference called `const listingsRef` and we can use `collection` from firestore which takes `db` and the collection name `"listings"` . After that we'll create a `query` and put it inside `const q` and we'll use the `query method` from firestore and this query will take `listingsRef` and `orderBy("timestamp", "desc"),limit(5))` as we want 5 listings only so we'll order them by their `timestamp` and in descending order `desc` so that the one which was created earlier is going to be first and the `limit` is 5 listings.

d. After the `query` we're going to get the data using the snap, so we create a variable `const querySnap` and this is going to `await` and we can use `getDocs` method from firestore to get the documents and this getDocs takes this `q` or query that we have. Now that we get the information, we'll create a variable called `const listings=[];` and its an empty array and we're going to fill it up using the `forEach` method, the `forEach` will loop through the listings, when a new listing is added it will loop everytime and add it to the empty listings[] that we created up. Then we say `setListings(listings)` but before that we need to create a `useState` hook, so we say `const [listings, setListings] = useState(null)` .

e. Then we need to add a loading effect to `Slider.jsx` so we create another state and call it `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)` and then we import the spinner and after `setListings(listings)` we put the code  `setLoading(false)` and after the `useEffect` code we return the spinner
```
{
if (loading){
    return <Spinner />
  }
  if (listings.length === 0) {
    return <></>;
  };
//if loading is true we return the spinner and if listing length is 0 we dont return the spinner we return
react fragments which means an empty container .
}
```

f. Then in the return statment of `Slider.jsx` component we add this , we use conditional rendering, that says if listings is not empty then run the code after the parenthesis after && , it'll map over the listings array and renders an h1 element for each listing. Note that the key prop is important for performance optimization in React, as it enables React to efficiently update and re-render only the necessary components when the underlying data changes. 
```
{
    listings && (
    <>
    {listings.map((listing) => (
      <h1 key={listing.id}>{listing.data.imgUrls[0]}</h1>
    ))}
    </>
    )
}
```
now we should be getting the img urls of the 5 images that we requested in h1 tags.

g. Now that we have the img urls we can complete the `Slider` , so we show these images inside a slider inside the `Home.jsx` , so we need to import `Swiper` components. check in the imports in `Slider.jsx`. above our `useEffect` hook we'll initialize Swiper `SwiperCore.use([Autoplay, Navigation, Pagination]);` , Now we can use them inside our project.

h. instead of returning the above code listings && () .... , we make some changes the return the below code
```
{


    <Swiper
    slidesPerView={1}
    navigation
    pagination={{type: "progressbar"}}
    effect="fade"
    modules={[EffectFade]}
    autoplay={{delay:3000}}
    >
    {listings.map(({data, id}) => (
      <SwiperSlide key={id}
      onClick={()=>navigate(`/category/${data.type}/${id}`)}>
      <div style={{background: `url(${data.imgUrls[0]}) center, no-repeat`,
      backgroundSize: "cover",
      }}
      className="relative w-full h-[300px] overflow-hidden"
      >
      </div>
      <p className="text-[#f1faee] absolute left-1 top-3 font-medium max-w-[90%]
      bg-[45] bg-[#457b9d] shadow-lg opacity-90 p-2 rounded-br-3xl">
      {data.description}</p>
      <p className="text-[#f1faee] absolute left-1 bottom-1 font-semibold max-w-[90%]
      bg-[45] bg-red-600 shadow-lg opacity-90 p-2 rounded-br-3xl">
      ${data.discountedPrice ?? data.regularPrice}
      {data.type === "rent" && " / month"}
      </p>
    ))}
    </Swiper>

1. We'll be putting the {listings.map} part inside the Swiper after the react fragments, and instead of just getting listing we'll destructure and get data and id.
2. instead of the h1 we'll use the <SwiperSlide> so we'll put the key inside <SwiperSlide key={id}> and then its going to have a onClick that is going to navigate the person to that listing page. so we need to initialize navigate so after SwiperCore.use we say const navigate = useNavigate() and we'll import it on the top.
3. inside SwiperSlide we'll have a onClick and this onClick will return a function that is going to navigate the person to that particular listing page, which is dynamic its inside a / category and it depends on the type so `${data.type}` and / the ${id} . Now we're able to redirect a person when he clicks on a image on the SwiperSlide when it appears to that page.
4. Now we need to add the <div> so that we can add the image and also we wanna add two paragraphs one for the title and one for the price of the listing. so after adding the div and the Swiper css + tailwind css class we can see the Swiper image is shown.
5. at this point we see only one image, because we didnt add the Swiper attribute such as AutoPlay, slidesPerview etc. so inside the <Swiper> we'll add some attributes aswell, see code above.
6. Now we need to add the title and the prices in the Swiper component.
7. so we'll add two <p> after the </div> , after styling the two p's with tailwind we add theses two lines of code
${data.discountedPrice ?? data.regularPrice} = data.discountedPrice is availible we return data.discountedPrice else we return data.regularPrice
{data.type === "rent" && " / month"} = if data.type is equal to rent which if truthy and so we return / month.


}
