a. In this section we're going to create the recent offers, places for rent and places for sale with each displaying the first four listings.

b. we'll use the `useEffect` hook to fetch the data and we'll go to `Home.js` and create a `useState` hook `const [offerListings, setOfferListings] = useState(null);` and also create a `useEffect` hook for `OfferListings` .

```
{

useEffect(()=>{
    const fetchListings = async ()=>{
      try {
        //get reference
        const listingsRef = collection(db, "listings")
        //create the query
        const q = query(listingsRef, where("offer", "==", true), 
        orderBy("timestamp", "desc"), limit(4));
        //execute the query
        const querySnap = await getDocs(q);
        const listings = [];
        querySnap.forEach((doc)=>{
          return listings.push({
            id: doc.id,
            data: doc.data(),
          });
        });
        setOfferListings(listings)
        console.log(listings)
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
      }
    }
    fetchListings()
  },[])

1. we create a async function called fetchListings() and we'll call the function just below.
2. after that we're going to have a try and catch block, in the suggestion you get that click on it.
3. we create a const listingRef which is the reference and we can use the collection which is coming from firestore which takes the db which is coming from the firebase file that we created before and with the collection we're going to target this listings
4. Now that we have the reference we can create the query, query is the condition of that request we will call it const q and this is going to use the query method from firestore which takes listingsRef and we are going to say where we wanna get the information from, so where is a firestore method so we say when offer is equal to true we wanna fetch the data. and then we can use orderBy method from firestore and we're going to orderBy timeStamp and in descending order so the listing created last will be first in the list and we wanna limit them to 4 listings, and limit is also a firestore method.
5. so after the query we get the information and using snapshot, we create a variable const querySnap and we can use await getDocs method thats coming from firestore and this getDocs will take the q or the query.
6. after that we're going to set it inside the offerListings that we created in the useState so it will be const listings = []
7. after that we're going to loop through the querySnap so we use forEach method and this one is going to give us each document and we're going to return and going to push each doc inside the listings array, so we're going to push it as an object and first we push doc.id and then doc.data()
8. we set the offer listings to this listings, setOfferListings(listings) and then im gonna console.log(listings)
9. lastly if there is an error in the catch block we're going to console.log(error) log that error.
10. when we go to our website and refresh it we'll be getting `the query requires an index` we click on that link and an index will be created inside firebase. after the index is created we can see our array of 4 listings.

}
```

c. we've already created the listings cards in `ListingItem.jsx` so we'll give the data to this `ListingItem.jsx` and display it in the offer part of the page in `Home.jsx` . so this is how react works we can create a component and it can be reusable in many places in our page.

d. so we go to `Home.jsx` and just under the <Slider /> we create a <div> and inside the div we say if offerListings exists and we check if offerListings length is greater than zero if both these statement are true , and && or then we're going to render that section by returning another <div> and inside this div we add an <h2> that says Recent Offers and we give some tailwind class to the div that is after the <Slider /> , and also some styling to the div that is returned if the condition is true, and also some tailwind class to the h2.

e. after the <h2> we're going to have a link to the offers page , so we're going to use the <Link> tag from react router dom and we need to import it aswell. and this link will take us to /offers <Link to="/offers"> . and inside the <Link> we'll have a <p> that says Show more offers and we'll tailwind css it.

f. After the <Link> we're going to add an <ul> and this ul is going to loop through offerListings.map using the map method and this is going to give us each listing and this is going to return the ListingItem component that we created already.

```
{
 <ul className='sm:grid sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4'>
              {offerListings.map((listing)=>(
                <ListingItem 
                key={listing.id} 
                listing={listing.data}
                id={listing.id}
                />
              ))}
            </ul>

1. sm:grid = small size and above should be grid, sm:grid-cols-2 = small size and above grid columns to be 2, its all about the responsiveness of the page.
}
```
Now the listings that has offers will be rendered, but we need to style them using grid.

g. Now we'll add the places for rent and places for rent. so as you can see it completely similar but just the query is different. so we can copy the code and change it a little bit to have these two sections aswell.

h. so for the rent we copy the same code starting from the `useState` hook till the end of `useEffect` hook and then we change the useState to `const [rentListings, setRentListings] = useState(null)` , then in the query line we say `"type" "==" "rent"` and instead of `setOfferListings` we say `setRentListings` . After all that refresh the home page and you will get an error from firebase with a link to create a query, so we click on the link to create the query.

i. then we'll also copy the line in the return statement starting from `{offerListings && ...}` and we make changes so it looks like `{rentListings && rentListings.length > 0 && (` and also we change the line that says `offerListings.map()` to `rentListings.map()` . we change the <h2> text to `Places for rent` , we change the <Link> to `<Link to="/category/rent">`
, we change the <p> to `Show more places for rent` 

j. and then for the sale we'll do the same as the above

i. Additionally if you wanna hide the scroll bar you can copy the below code in your app.css or index.css wherever you have your css saved.

html::-webkit-scrollbar{
    display:none;
//this removes it in chrome
}

html{
    scrollbar-width: none;
//removes it in other browsers like firefox
}

finally add it to github
git add .
