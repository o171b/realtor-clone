a. after the <ul> that houses the icons of baths, beds etc and inside the first child <div> in the `Listing.jsx` we'll create a <div> and inside it a <button> and that says `Contact Landlord` and we'll style it ofcourse. then we'll put a condition before this div that checks `if the current user is the owner of this listing` , but before that we'll `import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth' ` . Then we'll create a variable `const auth = getAuth()` which calls the getAuth method. Then we'll go back to the condition and say `{listing.userRef !== auth.currentUser?.uid}` then show us the button, so basically if the userRef === auth.currentUser.uid that would mean that we're seeing our own listing while being logged in our own account, so we dont want the page to show us `contact landlord` because in this case we're the landlord. and in auth.currentUser?.uid we use `optional chaining` so in case the page loaded faster and we dont wanna take chances and show the `contact landlord` so we protect it using optional chaining.
Then if this condition `{listing.userRef !== auth.currentUser?.uid}` is true we wanna see the `contact landlord button`
```
{
{listing.userRef !== auth.currentUser?.uid && (
     <div className='mt-6'>   
            <button className='px-7 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white font-medium text-sm uppercase rounded
            shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700 hover:shadow-lg focus:bg-blue-700 focus:shadow-lg
            w-full text-center transition duration-150 ease-in-out'
            >Contact Landlord
            </button>
            </div>
)}


}
```

b. Now that we've the button but when we click on it we wanna activate a piece of `state` that is going to remove this button and that is going to add a component which has a form or text box in which we can write our message.
so lets create that state `const [contactLandLord, setContactLandLord] = useState(false);` in our button that we created moments ago we'll add a `onClick` event listener `onClick={()=>setContactLandLord(true)}` so when we click on contact landlord we wanna switch the button to true. you can test it, right click on the button and click inspect then click on component and when you click on the button you can see the state changes to `true`. 

c. Now when the `contactLandLord` state is true that is when we click on the button and the state `turns` `true` we wanna remove this button and instead show a text box, so in `{listing.userRef}` we'll add another condition `!contactLandlord` if this if `false` we wanna see the button and when its true we cannot see the button.
`listing.userRef !== auth.currentUser?.uid && !contactLandLord && ` so as you can see we're checking two conditions 1. if the listing.userRef or the listing does not belong to the authorized user or logged in user then show us the `contact landlord button` and the second condition is 2. contactLandLord is false and the `&&` at the end is used for `short cirtcuit` the last `&&` adds an extra check to ensure the button only renders when intended, and prevents it from rendering in an unwanted falsy case. `This can be useful to avoid errors from null/undefined checks` . Without the last `&&` the `contact land lord` button will not be rendered.
Now when we click on the `contact LandLord` the button dissapers.

d. Now we wanna work on the form, But i dont wanna put it all inside `Listing.jsx` we'll create a seperate component for that and we wanna call that component instead. In the `components folder` we'll create a new component and we'll call it `Contact.jsx`.

e. after the closing curly brace of `{listing.userRef}` in `Listing.jsx` we can can just say `{contactLandLord && (<Contact />)}` = if contactLandLord is true then show this component (<Contact/>) which we'll create later. Now when we click on the `Contact LandLord` button we should see the component shown .

f. we go to `Contact.jsx` to complete our component. we'll use a `useEffect` hook to get the information from our database, first we'll check if the `landlord exists` and if it exists we need to get his `name` and `email`  and contact that land lord. so we'll add a `useEffect()` and inside the useEffect hook we'll create a function and call it `const getLandLord` and we'll make this function as `async` as it will be fetching data from the `firestore database`. And inside the body of this function we'll create a variable and call it `const docRef` and it will have the `doc` and the document will take three things, `db` the database, the collection `"users"` and `userRef` which is a unique reference number for each user eg: `0QZzkco7XMQki7w5DB3zro` . we go to `Listing.jsx` and pass the following props to the component 
<Contact
userRef={listing.userRef}
listing={listing}
 />

Then we go to the component `Contact.jsx` and receive the props `export default function Contact({userRef, listing})` we destructure them instead of receiving them as `props.userRef` and `props.listing` . once we have defined the location or address of the `doc` in firebase `const docRef = doc(db, "users", userRef)` we can add a snapshot for getting the `doc` like this `const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);` , now that we have the docSnap, we say if the person exists , so before that we'll define a piece of state, `const [landLord, setLandLord] = useState(null)` then we say `if(docSnap.exists()){setLandLord(docSnap.data)}` = if the person exists, we're using the exist method , then we'll fill the `setLandLord` with `docSnap.data` , `else` otherwise we'll toast an error `could not get landlord data`

g. in the return statement we say `<div>{landlord !== null && landlord.email}</div>` if we just say `landlord.email` we get an error, thats because `By using this null check, you are preventing the runtime error from occurring and ensuring that the email property is only accessed if the landlord object is not null or undefined.` . now when you click on `contact landlord` we get the email displayed.

h. in the return statement we change the <div> into <> `react fragments` and we return a <div> if the condition is satisfied.
```
{
     return <>{landlord !== null && (
          <div>
          <p>Contact {landlord.name} for the {listing.description.toLowerCase()}</p>
          <div>
          <textarea
          name="message" 
          id="message"
          rows="2"
          value={message}
          onChange={onChange} //we'll create a onChange function on the top
          ></textarea>
          </div>
          </div>
     )}</>
//after the <p> we'll  have a <div> for the text area and create a state
// const [message, setMessage] = useState("")
//then we'll create our onChange function

}
```

i. After the div that cover the <textarea> we'll create a button and we want this button to redirect the person so that we can message the landlord, so we'll use an anchor tag and the button will be inside the anchor tag see the code below

```
{
      <a
        href={`mailto:${landlord.email}?Subject=${listing.description}&body=${message}`}
        >
          <button>Send Message</button>

        </a>
}
```

now when you click on `send message` button it will direct you to your default mail.

i. next we'll style all those buttons etc. but first we'll adding a margin to our ul list in `Listing.jsx` then we'll style our <textarea> and then we'll style our <button>

j. then go the the div that houses this code `{listing.description} - $ {listing.offer ? 
              listing.discountedPrice.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',') :
              listing.regularPrice.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',')`
and make its class to be just with one property `w-full` remove all other properties. the reason we removed `h-[200px] lg-[400px]` is that we wanna make this to be seen as one unit

finally add everything to git hub
git add . = git add all
git commit -m "create the landlord contact component"
git push
