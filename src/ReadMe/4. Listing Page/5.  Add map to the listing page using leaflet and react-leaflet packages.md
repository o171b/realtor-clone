a. To have the map we need to install a package called `leaflet` . we go to google and search `react leaflet` , first we install two packages `npm i leaflet react-leaflet` . Then we need to add the `cdn` of this `leaflet` to our `index.html` for that you can search for `leaflet js` and go the the page and click on `download` and you can find the `cdn` copy it the one with the <link> tag.

b. We go to `Listing.jsx` and we go to the second child `div` , the first is the one we created for the `description, price, details etc` of the listing and the second `div` is for our `map` . we go to `react-leaflet.js.org` and copy the code inside the `live editor` for the `<MapContainer>` inside our second `div` . and after pasting we'll change this code `center={position}` to `center={[listing.lat, listing.lng]}` . import all this `import { MapContainer, Marker, Popup, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet';` . also we add this `style={{ height: "100%", width: "100%" }}` so that the map appears,  and this `position={[listing.geolocation.lat, listing.geolocation.lng]}` . Now you can see the map will be shown on the screen. 

c. for the popup on the map when we click it we want it to display the address so add this code `<Popup>
                {listing.address}
              </Popup>`
