In the final when you click on one of the listings, you will see an image slider on the top in which you can click on and go on the next image and previous image and we've a button for sharing the link and down we've a section related to the information of the listing like description rent etc and next to it we've a map.

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'react-router';
import { doc, getDoc } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { db } from '../firebase';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';
import SwiperCore, {EffectFade, Autoplay, Navigation, Pagination} from 'swiper';
import 'swiper/css/bundle';

a. Inside the `pages` folder create a file called `Listing.jsx` and rfc into it to create a react functional component, and then in `App.js` copy the `Offers` route or any other route and change its `path="/category/:categoryName/:listingId"` = after the category we've a parameter `:` which ask is it rent or sell so `categoryName` and after that we have another parameter which asks for the `listingId` . In the element we add the name of the component `{<Listing />}` Now we need to import the `Listing` .
Now if you go to our website and click on any listing, it will take you to the listing page, The url you get will be something like this `http://localhost:5173/category/rent/iM0UVkcskqDl1FwKIh1u` , and if you try to change in the `path` the `param` `:categoryName` to `cat` or any other name it'll work React would know whether its `sale` or `rent` based on the listing.

b. Now we can get the listing based on the url from the firebase database. Inside `Listing.jsx` we add `useEffect` hook and as usual the useEffect will call a function and make the dependencies array as an empty array for the time being. we need to have a function to get the data and the function should be `async` because we need to get return a `promise` using `await` for the `firebase` methods.
```
{
    const params = useParams();
    const [listing, setListing] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(()=>{
        const fetchListing = async ()=>{
            const docRef = doc(db, "listings", params.listingId)
            const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef)
            if (docSnap.exists()){
                setListing(docSnap.data())
                setLoading(false)
            }

        }
        fetchListing(params.listingId);
    },[])

1. Then we need to fetch the address, the address depends on the `collection` name and the `listingId` , so we need to get the listing Id using `useParams` hook. so we create a variable and put the useParams() inside it.
2. For the Address we create a variable called docRef , inside it we use the `doc` from firestore and the doc takes three things (db, "listings", params.listingId) = the database, the collection name "listings" and the params.listingId, listingId is coming from `App.js` .
3. After the reference which is the address of all our listings we can get the data by creating a variable `const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef) ` = and we'll use await and use the getDoc method from firestore, and this getDoc(docRef) is going to get (docRef), Now that we have this piece of info.
4. we say if the listing exists if(docSnap.exists(...)) = then we wanna set the listing, so we're gonna create a hook for listing after useParams(), const [listing, setListing] = useState(null) , so if it exists then we wanna set the listing to that information that we're getting which is `docSnap.data`
5. Then we'll add the loading effect, so we'll use a const [loading,setLoading] = useState(true); and after the info is fetched after this line `setListing(docSnap.data())` we'll set loading to false.
6. for Dependencies we can add `params.listingId` .
7. The instructor wasn't able to console.log(listing) , he was getting null because the object was not fetched, his mistake was he was putting console.log(listing) inside the function body and not after the dependencies array.
8. in dependencies array add this `[params.listingId]` and after this if you want to `console.log(list)` you can get the object, with name,description,bedrooms etc. after that we'll add the loading spinner 
```
{
if (loading){
        return <Spinner />;
    }
}
```
and then in the return statement we'll return 
```
{
    return <div>{listing.description}</div>
}
```
when you click on the listing you can find the object gets loaded on the screen for eg: "Spacious Town House in Brand New Condition" will be shown.

9. Now its time to add a picture slider , we're going to add a package called swiper, google for the package with name `swiper`  , we'll install swiper `npm i swiper` Then we'll import it , see top for imports. After that inside the Listing() , we need to use the `SwiperCore.use` that we imported to initialize and use (Autoplay, Navigation, Pagination) , now swiper is ready to be used.

10. In the return statement we have a div tag, we'll change it to <main> . And we'll put the `<Swiper> </Swiper> inside it and remove the {listing.description} . And inside the <Swiper> we're going to map the images.
```
{
<main>
          <Swiper 
            slidesPerView={1} 
            navigation 
            pagination={{type: "progressbar"}}
            effect='fade' 
            modules={[EffectFade]} 
            autoplay={{delay:3000}} 
          >
            {listing.imgUrls.map((url,index)=>(
              <SwiperSlide key={index}>
                <div 
                  className='relative w-full overflow-hidden h-[300px]'
                  style={{background: `url(${listing.imgUrls[index]}) center no-repeat`,
                  backgroundSize: "cover"
                  }}
                >
                </div>
              </SwiperSlide>
            ))}
          </Swiper>
        </main>

1. inside the <Swiper> we're going to add listing.imgUrls we going to map through imgUrls and get each url and also we get the index of the url and after that we're going to return the <SwiperSlide></SwiperSlide> and we'll add a key to SwiperSlide because its a map, and inside the <SwiperSlide> we'll add a <div> .
2. inside the <div inside here> we'll add tailwind styling and css styling using style={{}} , in style the first curly braces are for jsx and the second is for css style object. in the style we'll add background image and the background image has the url, but the url is dynamic because it depends on the url so inside the url we'll let it fetch the image dynamically which is coming from listing.imgUrls and the index is the [index] . And after that we're going to bring it in center and we dont wanna have the repeat.
3. we're gonna have some tailwind css aswell w-full overflow-hidden h-[300px] .
4. And for the <Swiper> itself we have some attributes , for eg: we wanna show one image per view and make it 1 and we wanna have navigation , and pagination type to be progressbar, then we wanna have the effect to be fade then we wanna use the module which is EffectFade that we've imported. You can find all this in the documentation of swiper, no need to by heart it. and we wanna set the autoplay delay to be 3 seconds 3000ms.
5. Now you can test it and it should be working.
6. You'll see the arrow's with which we change the color to be blue, but we wanna change its color to silvery so it can only be done from our App.css file. we add this code
.swiper-button-next:after,
.swiper-button-prev:after{
    color: #a8dadc;
}
7. And for pagination progress bar we add this code in app.css, these things you can find github or by searching the internet. we make it important to override the existing css class.
.swiper-pagination-progressbar .swiper-pagination-progressbar-fill{
    background: #a8dadc; !important
}
8. And also we need to add relative for the tailwind class inside the div and in the style={{}} we add backgroundSize: "cover"
}
```

11. Another thing we wanna put SwiperCore.use([]) inside brackets. and now we'll get the progress bar on top.
