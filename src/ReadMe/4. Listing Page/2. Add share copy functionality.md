After implement the swiper, Now we wanna add the share button, when we click on the share button it should should `link copied` .

1. After the `Swiper` in our `Listing.jsx` lets add a div and inside this div we're going to add an icon, so lets check on React icons website and search for `share` , and we want the one from font awesome Fa this one `FaShare` and we import it `import { FaShare } from "react-icons/fa";` and add this icon inside the div <FaShare /> .

2. Now we need to position it so inside the div that holds our share icon we wanna add this class `<div className=fixed top-[13%] right-[3%] z-10 bg-white cursor-pointer border-2 border-gray-400 rounded-full w-12 h-12 flex justify-center items-center>` = fixed (we wanna make the icon fixed), top-[13%] (make it 13% at the top regardless of the size of the page), right-[3%] (always on 3% to the right), the icon wont showup so we make the `z10` (z index 10) , `flex` (make the div container as flex) , `justify-center` (align items horizontally on the x axis) , `items-center` (align items vertically on the y axis).

3. Some tailwind classes for `<FaShare className='text-lg text-slate-600' />` , `text-lg` (makes the icon bigger) 

4. Now we'll add functionality to the icon. So we'll add a `onClick` to the div holding the icon, and this onClick event listener is going to copy the link of the page. so we're going to call a function...
```
{

onClick={()=>{
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href)
    setShareLinkCopied(true);
}}

1. This function is going to call `navigator.clipboard` which is a js object , writeText is a method of navigator object and window.location.href is a property that returns the current URL of the web page as a string. Now when we click on the icon the link gets copied.

}
```

5. When we click on the share icon , a text should be displayed saying `link copied` to do that we need to create a useState hook to give it a state so we create it at the top and we'll call it `const[shareLinkCopied, setShareLinkCopied] = useState(false)` . Then inside the div that holds the icon we're going to make it true `setShareLinkCopied(true)` but after two seconds we wanna make it false, so we'll use setTimeOut method. setTimeout method will have two things inside it, first a function to be called 
```
{
    setTimeout(()=>{
              setShareLinkCopied(false);
            }, 2000);
}
```
