1. FireBase setup

a. when we go to the sign up page, and when we let the fullname,email address fields empty and click on signup we should get a notification we should get a toast notification that says "something went wrong with registration" , so we'll install a package called `react toastify` . 

b. but first lets create our `firebase` database, go to `firebase.google.com` and login with your google account. Then click on `console` and we're going to create a new project so click on `Add Project` and we give a name to our project so we'll name it `realtor-clone-react` and continue, then you will be asked for `google analytics` i will disable it for now, we can use it later and then click on `create project` .

c. You will be redirected to the and you will see `Get started by adding firebase to your app` and you will have three options, click on `web` . Then we need to add `nickname` for our app i will put the same name `realtor-clone-react`, make sure to uncheck `Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app` as we'll be deploying our app to `vercel`, then click on `Register App` . Now firebase will be giving us the `Firebase SDK` software development kit.

d. Next we need to install `firebase` in our `vs code terminal` using `npm install firebase` . We need to create a file called `firebase.js` or `firebase.config` in `src` folder and copy the code that we get in the screen and paste it in `firebase.js` . delete `const app=` from the code that we copied, we need to add this code for the firebase storage `import {getFirestore} from "firebase/firestore"` and in the last line we export it `export const db = getFirestore()` and let rest of the code as it is then go to the `firebase` website and click `continue to console` .

e. Click on `build` then `authentication` then we click on `get started` this will take us to the `signin` providers page, we'll add `email and password` as our first provider and click on `enable` then click on `add new provider` and we can select `google` , click on `enable` and in `public facing name` give `realtor-clone-react` this is useful when in your final version of the website when we click on `login with google` we get this name on the `signin popup screen` and in `project support email` choose your email and click on `save`.

f. Then click on `build` again and click on `firestore database` then click on `create database` then click on `production mode` then you need to chose the `location` of your `cloud storage` so whatever location is closes to you chose it, for me i chose `mumbai` because in the list closest location to `uae` is `india` and click on `enable` .

g. then we need to add the `firebase database rules` , so the instructor has a txt file in his github profile, i just copied it to the `src` folder for reference with file name `firebase rules.txt` . firebase uses `cel` `common expression language` for the rules.

h. click on `rules` , in the `firebase rules.txt` copy the rules under the heading `firestore rules` and paste them in `firestore rules` page, make sure to delete whatever default code is written and then click on publish.

i. next click on `build` and click on `storage` , click on `get started` , click on `start in production mode` , click on `rules` and delete whatever default code is in code editor and paste the code in the `firebase rules.txt` under the heading `storage rules` and click on `publish` .

2. SignUp

a. in `signUp.jsx` when we go to the `<form>` we can see that there is no `onSubmit` event handler for the form, so we'll add it `<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>` the `onSubmit` will call a function and that function also we'll call it as `onSubmit` and we create a function
```
{
 const onSubmit = (e) =>{
    e.preventDefault();
  }
}
```
as we're working on react so what this `e.preventDefault()` does is that it prevent the page from refresh, in react we create `SAP` so we dont want any page refreshes.

b. Now we want to authenticate the user, search on google for `firebase authentication` , in the menu on the left click on `web` and click on `get started` we'll find two versions `web version 9` and `web version 8` , we'll use `web version 9` there is a method called `getAuth` we need to import it to our application `import {getAuth} from "firebase/auth"` . For creating a user with email and password there is a method in firebase so we'll also `import {createUserWithEmailAndPassword} from "firebase/auth"` so both of them will be imported as `import { getAuth, createUserWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";` . When we check the `web version 9` we can see it uses `.then and .catch` its a bit old fashioned so we'll be using `try and catch` statement. So we go to vs code and in the `onSubmit` event handler function we add the `try and catch` statement and this is how the code will look like and we make the function asynchronous.
```
{
  const onSubmit = async (e) =>{
    e.preventDefault()
    
    try {
      const auth = getAuth()
      const userCredential = await
      createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
      const user = userCredential.user
      console.log(user)
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  }
}
```
the email and password are coming from our formData hook.
after doing that we will get an error `FirebaseError: Firebase: Need to provide options, when not being deployed to hosting via source. (app/no-options).`
so we need to `import {db} from "../firebase"` if you remember we've `exported the db in our firebase.js` . Now when we enter the name, email and password and signup we get in the console an `object` with `a bunch of data` , we have a `token, email etc etc`, firebase gives the user 1 month for verification and then the token gets destroyed . Now if you go to firebase and then authentication we see that we have our registered user added.

c. Now i wanna add the `name` aswell because we've our name in the `formData` but its not getting added in the authentication `the object that we checked before when we sign up` . We can use a method called `updateProfile` which is coming from `firebase/auth` so we add it along with the other methods `import { getAuth, createUserWithEmailAndPassword, updateProfile } from "firebase/auth";` and we also add it in the `onSubmit` event handler like this
```
{
 const onSubmit = async (e) =>{
    e.preventDefault()
    
    try {
      const auth = getAuth()
      const userCredential = await
      createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
      
      updateProfile(auth.currentUser, {
        displayName: name
      })

      const user = userCredential.user
      console.log(user)
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  }
}
```
we can `updateProfile` update the profile, and `updateProfile()` is getting the current user and the current user is available inside `auth.currentUser` and the update we wanna do is we wanna put inside the `object` `displayName` and this is going to be equal to name `{displayName : name}` and this `name` will be coming from `formData` .
So try and create another user and you will see the same object in the console but this time in the object you will find `displayName` .

d. In firebase you can check the user is authenticated in `Authentication` menu , in the next step, we'll add user to the `Firestore database` aswell , and also we can add image urls, address and many other data inside the database.
we wanna add the `formData` to the database, but the problem is that we've a `password` and we don't wanna save the password inside the database, because firebase has a system for saving the password , click on `authentication` and `password hash parameters` and you can find the method in which `firebase` saved the password, so we don't wanna save it in `database` as its already `hashed` and saved in `authentication` .
```
{
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name : '',
    email : '',
    password : '', //we dont wanna save this password in the database
  });
}
```
so we add these lines to `const user`

```
{
const user = userCredential.user;
const formDataCopy = {...formData} //we spread it, so we get everything inside formData and put it inside formDataCopy
delete formDataCopy.password //now we can delete the password
formDataCopy.timestamp = serverTimeStamp();//we can add the time that the person registered, we will not use the date constructor from js, we'll use a firebase method , () this at the end denotes that the function is being called

await setDoc(doc(db,"users", user.uid), formDataCopy)//this returns a promise so we'll add await here and setDoc is going to get (doc) which is coming from firestore this doc is going to get three things (db,) a database, and we'll save it inside a collection we call the collection "users" , and we wanna save it with the same id that we get in firebase authentication User UID so the (user.uid) gives us this id and the second argument formDataCopy object will update the document with the new data, including the time stamp, whatever inside the formData is copied to setDoc for FireStore document.
}
```
make sure to `import {doc}` , i was getting an error because i didnt import it.
Now if you go to `firebase` website in `firestore database` you can see the `collection users` `document` and `email name and timestamp` , so our userdata is getting saved in the `database` .

e. After sign up i wanna redirect the person to the homepage. we can use the `use Navigate` hook which comes from `react-router-dom` . so we'll import it first `import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"` . And then we need to initialize it, so after `const {name,email,pass} ...` we add this line `const navigate = useNavigate()` , and then below the code for adding a user to the database i wanna navigate to the homepage, so after the code `await setDoc...` and above `catch error` we wanna navigate to the homepage `navigate("/")` .

f. The next thing we wanna do is , add a notification instead of console loggin the error. so we'll be going to install a package called `react toastify` , so google `react toastify` and go to `documentation` so we can edit the style of the notification pop up. so we select `bottom center` and we wanna set the theme to `dark` . so first thing first we install it using `npm i react-toastify` . then we copy the code inside the `toast container` and we paste it inside `app.js` because we want to unify the notification in all our pages and we paste it after the `<Router />` before the closing fragment `</>` and we also need to import it `import {ToastContainer} from "react-toastify"` . And we need to import the css file aswell, so we need to go to `installation` and under the heading `The gist` we can just get the css file we copy `import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css` paste it in app.js , this import might change so always google `react toastify` and check their page.

g. Now inside signup.js , instead of console loggin the error
so first we'll import it , `import {toast} from "react-toastify"`
```
{
catch (error) {
      console.log(error); //we remove this line
      toast.error("Something went wrong with the Registration") //this way the notification will be read
}
}
```
Now go to the sign up page and leave the form empty and click on signup you will see the notification.
and you can further customize the notification, so incase of success registration we'll give a message `Sign up was successful`
we can put this code after 
`await setDoc(doc(db,"users", user.uid), formDataCopy)`
so we'll put this code `toast.success("Sign up was successful")`
but we might not need this, as upon successful login you can see your profile on most websites thats the way. so i will comment this line.

h. lastly we'll add everything to github, `git add .` = git add all
`git commit -m "install firebase and react toastify and signup the user"`
`git push` and we push it to github.
