1. 
a. In this section we'll work with `continue with google button` , so we'll work on `OAuth.jsx` component.
First we'll add an `onClick` event handler to our button `<button onClick={onGoogleClick}>` and assign it to a function called `onGoogleClick` , So we need to create a function before the return statement
`const onGoogleClick = ()=>{}` . Now when you click on `continue with google` we get a `toast error` that says `something went wrong` but we dont want this error to appear for the `google button` we want it only for the `signup` button and the reason we get this message is that `google button` is inside the form which contains `signup` button, so in `OAuth.jsx` inside the `button` we'll change the type to `type="button"` as the `signup` button type is `submit` , Now when we click on `continue with google` the `toast message` dissapears.

b. First make sure to import `import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth"` `import { toast } from "react-toastify"` 
If you go google `firebase authentication` click on `web` and then click on `google` you will find a documentation for logging in with google. So we go to VScode and inside `onGoogleClick()` function we add a `try` and `catch` statement 
```
{
try{
const auth = getAuth() //getAuth is coming from firebase/auth
const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider() //after getting auth we need to create the provider
}
catch(error){
toast.error("Could not authorize with Google")
}
}
```

c. Sign in with Google Popup returns a `promise` so we need to change the `onGoogleClick()` to async
```
{
const onGoogleClick = async ()=>{
try{
    const auth = getAuth()
    const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider()
    const result = await SignInWithPopup(auth,provider) //we can get the result from SignInWithPopup which comes from firebase/auth which gets the auth and the provider.
    const user = result.user //finally user will be result.user
    console.log(user) //to check if there is any error
}
catch(error){
    toast.error("Could not authorize with Google")
    console.log(error) //to check for any error
}
  }
}
```

d. Now its time to add the user to the database, as in `firebase` when we go to `authentication` we can find the user but in `Firestore database` the user is not availible. 
before all that make sure to import `import { serverTimestamp, setDoc, doc, getDoc } from 'firebase/firestore';`
`import { db } from "../firebase"`
```
{
const onGoogleClick = async ()=>{
    try {
      const auth = getAuth();
      const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider()
      const result = await signInWithPopup(auth,provider)
      const user = result.user

      //check for the user if already in database
      const docRef = doc(db, "users", user.uid) //we need to create reference which is like an address
      //we can add the address using the doc method from firebase/firestore and this gets three things
      //the database the collection name and the id. the db is coming from the firebase.js

      const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef) //now that we have the reference we can get the user,
      //this will check all the documents for the uid, if its availible we get it inside docSnap.
      //any availible uid gets populated here.

      //here we'll use if else statement to check if uid is availible or not
      //if docSnap doesnt exist, we add it to the database
      if (!docSnap.exists()){
        await setDoc(docRef, {
            name: user.displayName,
            email: user.email,
            timestamp: serverTimeStamp() //all these come from firebase
            //if you console.log user you can find them all
        })
      }
      
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error("Could not authorize with Google")
      
    }
  }
}
```
Now you can check `Firebase Database` on firebase website, and you can find the user added to the database.

e. Last thing we can do is redirect the person to the homepage after logging using `google` .
`import { useNavigate } from 'react-router';` and initialize it at the top inside the `OAuth()` function
`const navigate = useNavigate()` and after signing up the person after the following code `if(!docSnap.exists()){...}` put this code `navigate("/")` navigate to home.

f. Now lets add all this to github
`git add .` git add all
`git commit -m "complete the Oauth functionality"`
`git push` to push them to the github repository
