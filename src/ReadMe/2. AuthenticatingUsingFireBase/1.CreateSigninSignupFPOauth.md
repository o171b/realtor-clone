1. 
a. In the final version the background of our page is light green, so in app.css were we've imported our css classes we set the, ``body {background-color: rgb(240,253,244);}``

b. The next thing i wanna do is add the sign in to the center of the page, so we go to SignIn.jsx file, here instead of just having a `div` i wanna change it to `section` and inside of `section` we'll add `h1` saying `Sign In` and give the `h1` some className of tailwind.

c. `className="text-3xl text-center mt-6 font-bold"`
i will make the text for Sign In to `text-3xl` , then we'll bring it to the center using `text-center`, then we wanna bring it a bit down, by saying `mt-6` margin top, and make it a lil bitter thicker by `font-bold`

d. Now lets add the image and the form, but first lets plan the structure, so we've one `div` that is both covering the `img` and the `form` , then we've one `div` covering the `img` and one `div` that is covering the `form` tag, we'll have a `parent div` and `two child div's`.  So we'll be using the `display flex` to bring them next to each other, but we're going to change the `flex wrap to wrap` so that in smaller screens the form gets under the image and not next to each other.

e. for the image, just go to `unsplash.com` and search for `key`, right click on the image and click `copy image address` . and for the second `div` that houses `form` tag, we'll give it a `input` tag with `type=text`

f. Now lets style the two `div's` that we've , for the `div` that houses the `img` , add a `className="md:w-[67%] lg:w-[50%] mb-12 md:mb-6 "`
for the `img` for mobile screen viewing we'll make it full size, but for medium or large screens i wanna change the width, `md:w-[67%]` = for the medium sized screens, i wanna change the width to be 67% ,
`lg:w-[50%]` = then for the large screens i wanna change the width to be even smaller so we'll make it 50% , `mb-12` = lets add some margin aswell , we'll add margin bottom as 12, `md:mb-6` = for medium sized screens and above i wanna change the margin bottom to 6.

g. and for the image itself, lets add some `className=w-full rounded-2xl"` , `w-full` = we want the `img` width to be always the same as its parent `div` which houses the `img` tag, `rounded-2xl` = and i want the image to be rounded at the corners.

h. for the `div` which is parent of `form` lets add some `className="w-full md:w-[67%] lg:w-[40%]"` , `w-full` = for mobile screens i wanna the width to be full, and for medium and large screens 67% and 40% . This is going to help the `flex wrap` to decide to bring them on top of each other or next to each other, for eg: in the large screens the `div` that contains the `img` has a `lg:w-[50%]` and the `form` has a `lg:w-[40%]` so thats not 100%, we've 10% less hence the form and image come next to each other, but for the medium `md:w-[67%]` we have 67% for the `img` aswell as the `form` so `img` comes on top of `form` because they're more than 100% in width, then in the mobile size the width is full `w-full` so they cannot be next to each other, so the image comes on top of the form.

i. Now we wanna style the top `div` which is the parent of the `div` containing the `img` and the `div` containing the `form` . `className='flex justify-center flex-wrap items-center px-6 px-12 max-w-6xl mx-auto'` , `flex` = when you make it flex they come next to each other, `justify-center` = to make both the `div's` containing the `img` and `form` to the center, `flex-wrap` = then we wanna make the flex to be wrap, so that when we decrease the width of the window, the image is on top of the form, `items-center` = we'll bring the items inside both the `div` to the center relative to each other, then lets add some padding `px-6 py-12` = to push then a little bit inside, and we want the maximum width to be `max-w-6xl` this is the same size that we used for the header, but they're not in the center, so we can use `mx-auto` = to bring them to the center.

j. the last thing i wanna in the `div` containing the form is to move the form a lil bit away from the image so `lg:ml-20` = lg screen margin left to 20.

2. 
a. Next we need to setup the email and password forms, in the `div` that has our `form` we will change the `type="email"` and `id=email` and the `value={email}` ,  to define the `value=email` and to make the form work as intended, we need to `import {useState} from "react"` , and use a hook 
`const [formData, setFormData] = useState(email : "",password : "",});` , after that we need to destructure this formData `const {email,password} = formData` email and password is coming from the formData, now we can use the email variable inside our form.

b. Then we'll use an `onChange` event handler, we'll create a function called `onChange()` we'll give it the same name as the event handler. `onChange = (event){console.log(event.target.value);}` if we console log and then we type in the form we just get the letter that we're typing, but we need the previous letter that we typed aswell. 
```
{
 const onChange = (event)=>{
    setFormData((prevFormData)=>({
      ...prevFormData,
      [event.target.id] : event.target.value,

    }))
  }
}
```
Inorder to do that we can use, the useState hook and `setFormData` use the setter method of our state, and let it give us the `prevFormData` , then we'll spread the prevFormData data, `...prevFormData` , `[event.target.id]:event.target.value` then we'll target the `id` attribute of our value `email` and which will be equal to `event.target.value` , so whatever we type will be saved in the `formData`
Now if you go to dev tools, console, components you can and focus on the form , you can see our useState hook gets updated as we type.
lets add a `placeholder = "Email address"` .

c. for styling the tailwind css provides basic styling, so we'll download another plugin called `tailwindcss forms` search for it and it will take you to the github page, and follow the instructions to install it. After installing the plugin , run the server and pay attention to the form, it will have a different basic styling.
in the `className="w-full px-4 py-2 text-gray-700 bg-white border-gray-300 rounded transition ease-in-out "`
`w-full` = width of our form is full size, `px-4` = some adding in the x-axis horizontally, `py-2` = some padding to the y-axis vertically, `text-xl` = make the text a tad bigger,
`transition ease-in-out` = when we click on the form the border animation appears dynamically and not instantly.

d. Now lets do the same for the password, but i will put it inside another `div` , the reason i wanna put it in another div is that , i wanna add the eye icon and i wanna make the icon to `position absolute` inside the `div` , copy paste the `input` tag of the email and paste it inside another `div` below it. now if we type the password we see dots, means password is invisible, but we wanna make it dynamic, so that when we click on the eye button the password appears and when we click on it again the password vanishes, so we need to have a variable for that.
we need to go and create another hook at top, and we wanna say, if this `showPassword` is false just make the `type="password"` else if `showPassword` is false make it `type="text"` . so instead of just `type="password"` we'll make it dynamic `type={showPassword ? "text" : "password"}` 
``` 
{
const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false)
} 
```

e. So at this point the functionality is working as intended, Now we just need to add the icon, i wanna use a package called `React icons` , so search on google for that and you will get the github page and follow the installation instructions using npm.
Then i wanna search for an `eye icon` and use the two eye icons, one for visible password and other for hide password. Click on the icon and it will be get copied to the clipboard, just after the `</input>` we add a condition , if `showPassword` is true then show us the following icon.
then we need to import the icons at the top `import { AiFillEyeInvisible , AiFillEye} from 'react-icons/ai' ;`
```
{
{showPassword ? (
              <AiFillEyeInvisible />) :
              (< AiFillEye />
            )}
}
```

f. Now that we have our eye icon, we wanna position it to `absolute` and make its parent `<div>` as `relative` , so the `eyeIcon` position is `relative` to the parent `<div>` , that means any changes to the parent `<div>` will effect the `eyeIcon` which is a child element.
then we'll add these css properties:
```
{
{showPassword ? (
              <AiFillEyeInvisible className='absolute right-3 top-3 text-xl cursor-pointer' />) :
              (< AiFillEye className='absolute right-3 top-3 text-xl cursor-pointer' />
            )}
}
```

g. then we'll add an `onClick` event handler, so that when we click on the eye icon we can toggle between show and hide password.
```
{
{showPassword ? (
              <AiFillEyeInvisible className='absolute right-3 top-3 text-xl cursor-pointer'
              onClick={()=>setShowPassword((prevState)=>!prevState)} />) :
              (< AiFillEye className='absolute right-3 top-3 text-xl cursor-pointer'
              onClick={()=>setShowPassword((prevState)=>!prevState)} />
            )}
}
```

h. in the email address i need to add `mb-6` margin bottom 6 and i wrapped the email form structure inside a `div` previously for the email it was `<form>` and form had an `<input>` directly, for better structuring i wrapped it inside a `div` just as the `password` part.

3. 
a. We wanna have two links, one is for `Register` and the other if `Forgot password` , so we have one `<div>` that is covering both of them and we just use `display flex` to bring them next to each other. so after the  `<div>` that covers the password , we add another `<div>` and we have a `<p>` saying `Don't have an account? Register` but we wanna have `Register` inside a `<Link>` tag , and this `<Link>` comes from `react-router-dom` and it has to Link to `sign-up` page.
After this paragraph we'll have another paragraph for `forgot-password` inside it we'll have a `<Link>` tag and it will go `to=/forgot-password` page.


```
{
 <div className='flex'>
              <p>Don't have an account?
                <Link to="/sign-up"> Register</Link>
              </p>
              <p>
                <Link to="/forgot-password">Forgot Password</Link>
              </p>
             </div>
}
```

b. Then we'll bring both the `<p>` next to each other, so the top `<div>` that is covering both the `<p>` tags , `<div className="flex justify-between whitespace-nowrap text-sm sm:text-lg">` , we just change the `display to flex` so we bring them next to each other, and we want one `<p>` to be on the right and the other `<p>` to be on the left so we'll use `justify-between` which is equivalent to css `justify content space between` , just in case if the screen is really small i dont want both my `<p>` to go to the second line so we change the `whitespace-nowrap` , then we make the `text-sm` for mobile screen , and for screen's larger than mobile screens we can change the text to be large `sm:text-lg`

c. then we add some space below our `<p>` tag, so we say `mb-6` we give it some margin bottom property. Then we will style our `Links` so after the `Link to=` we add a `className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-700 transition duration-200 ease-in-out ml-1"` , `hover:text-red-700` = when we hover over the text we want the color to change, `transition duration-200` = we want the effect to take place in 200ms, `ease-in-out` = we want the animation to be ease in and out, `ml-1` = we want to push the `Register` a lil bit to the left so we use the margin left property.

d. for the forgot password we add `className='text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 transition duration-200 ease-in-out'`

4.
a. Now its time to add a button, for `SIGN IN` , so after our `<div>` that contains `dont have an account` and `forgot password` we add a button with `type="submit"` with text `Sign-in`, and then lets add the styling `className="w-full bg-blue-600 text-white px-7 py-3 text-sm font-medium uppercase rounded shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700 transition duration-150 ease-in-out hover:shadow-lg active:bg-blue-800"`
`w-full` = we want the width of the `sign-in` button is to utilize the full width of the `<div>` container that houses the `email` and `password` . `font-medium` = is the font weight, `uppercase` = text to be uppercase , `shadow-md` = add some shadow effect to the button, shadow medium, `hover:shadow-lg` = when hovering we want the shadow to be larger, `active:bg-blue-800` = when we click on the sign in button we want the button to be darker.

5.
a. we'll have an `or` text with two lines, one on the left and one on the right, so after the `<button>` tag we'll have a `<div>` tag that will house the text `OR` inside a `<p>` tag. we'll add the following tailwind classes to the `<p className="text-center font-semibold mx-4">OR</p>`
`mx-4` = because we want to have space between `or` and the lines.
b. now lets create the lines, in the `<div className="my-4 flex items-center before:border-t before:flex-1 before:border-gray-300">`
`my-4` = we'll have a margin, so we'll have some space in the top and bottom, `before:border-t` = we'll use before pseudo class to add a border at the top but we cannot see that border yet, `flex` = display flex, when we add flex, the `OR` comes at the beginning, and now we need to add line before, `before:flex-1` = this will push the `OR` to the end and now you can see the line, it is flex-grow-1 so initially the value is 0 we want the line to grow by 1 and take the remaining space before `OR`, `items-center` = to bring the line to the center in y axis or vertically, `before:border-gray-300` = the color of the border, then we can do the same for the after, just copy the before lines and paste them and change them to after. 

6.
a. Now we've to add the `continue with Google button` , and this button will be common among all the pages, so if we go to `sign-in` page we see it, in `forgot-password` page we see it, and also in `Register` we see it. So instead of creating this `continue with Google button` every time for each page, we'll create a component and add the component in these pages. 
so in the `components folder` we'll create a component called `OAuth.jsx` , so after the `<div>` that contains the `OR` we add the `<OAuth />` component, now under the text `OR` we see `OAuth`, now we can work on the `OAuth` component in its file.
b. inside the `OAuth` component, we put the following code inside a button `<button>Continue with Google</button>` and we also wanna have the `Google icon` before the text, so we go to `react-icons.github.io` and search for google, find the icon and click on it , it will be copied and paste it before the text as a component it will be something like this `<FcGoogle />` .
c. give `className='flex items-center justify-center w-full bg-red-700 text-white px-7 py-3 uppercase text-sm font-medium hover:bg-red-800 active:bg-red-900 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg active:shadow-lg transition duration-150 ease-in-out rounded` to the `<button>` to bring the google icon next to the text continue with google, `items-center` to align the google icon vertically in the y axis, `justify-center` to align the items in the center of the container, `w-full` this will take the full or 100% width of its parent now you will see you items centered.
d. for the `<FcGoogle>` lets style it by giving it a tailwind className , `ClassName ="text-2xl bg-white rounded-full mr-2"`
`text-2xl` to make the google icon larger, `bg-white` to make the icon background white, `rounded-full` to make the background rounded 100%, `mr-2` lets give it a margin right of 2 so that we have some space between the google icon and the text next to it. So that's it for the sign-in page.

7. 
a. The `sign-up` page is exactly the same as the `sign-in` page plus it has a `Full Name` input field, so we can simply copy the `sign-in` page code and change it a little bit and create the `sign-up` page, so after copying, lets tweak the `sign-up` page.
b. we'll start at the top, the name of the function should be `export default function SignUp()` , the formData should have extra things, `const[formData, setFormData] = useState({name:"", email:"", password:""})` , and then we're gonna `destructure` the `formData` and we add name aswell `const{name,email,password} =  formData` , we'll leave the `onChange` as it is, then the `h1` tag should be `Sign-Up` , and then we need to add another `input` so we copy the first input and past it above. make the type as `text`, id=`name` , value=`{name}` , placeholder=`Ful name`, then instead of `don't have an account` we say `Have an account` and we `Link to="/sign-in"` and instead of the text `Register` we say `Sign in`, and in the button which says `Sign-in` and put `Sign-up`.
c. for the Forgot password page we can do the same thing, we just have an `email address` input field, and in the button we have `send reset email` . so we go back to `Sign-in` page and copy the code and paste it in `Forgot-password` page. first we remove the `password` input, and delete its icons that we imported on the top, then we delete the `const[showPassword]` hook as we don't need it, then we dont need `const[formData,setFormData]` so we change it to `const[email,setEmail]` and we dont need `email:"" , password: ""` so we make it an empty string `("")` as initial value and we dont need the `destructuring` part so we delete it `const{email,password}=formData` and make sure to change the function name to `ForgotPassword()` , for the `onChange` event handler we make it to 

```
{
const onChange = (event)=>{
    setEmail(event.target.value);
  }
}
```
instead of the `Forgot Password` we can say `Sign in instead` , this is going to sign in `Link to="/sign-in"` and we change the `sign-in` button to `send reset password`.

8. Now lets add everything to the github, so `git add .` = git add all, `git commit -m "create sign in , sign up and forgot password pages and oauth component" ` = git commit with a message, `git push` = we push it to github.
