1. 
a. In the `forgot password` page we just need one input that is the `email` and if you click on `send reset password` firebase is going to send an email with a link to reset our password. we can use a method called `sendPasswordResetEmail` from `firebase/auth`.
make sure to `import { toast } from "react-toastify";`

b. in `ForgotPassword.jsx` in the `<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>` the onSubmit event handler will call a function `onSubmit` . so the `onSubmit()` will be `async` because the `sendPasswordResetEmail` method from `firebase/auth` returns a `promise` . so before the return statement create the onSubmit function
```
{
const onSubmit = async (e)=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    try{
        const auth = getAuth(); //this method comes from firebase/auth
        await sendPasswordResetEmail(auth, email) //this gets the auth and email
        //email we're getting from useState hook
        toast.success("Email was sent")

    }catch(error){
     toast.error("Could not send reset password")
    }
}
}
```

c. add to github
`git add .` git add all
`git commit -m "complete the forgot password functionality"`
`git push` push it to github
