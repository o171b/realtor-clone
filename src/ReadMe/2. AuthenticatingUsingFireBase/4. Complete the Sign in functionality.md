a. In this section we'll complete the signin functionality, if you go to firebase in `authentication` you can find a few accounts that we've created we want to login with those accounts and want to be taken to homepage after logging in. 

b. So we need to go to `SignIn.jsx` and we need to add `onSubmit` etc etc. We need to import a few things `import { signInWithEmailAndPassword, getAuth } from "firebase/auth"` `import { toast } from "react-toastify"` `import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';`. Then we'll add `onSubmit` to the `<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>` which calls a function called `onSubmit()` . Lets create the function before the return statement, and this `onSubmit` function should be `async` and we're going to use `await` which is going to return a `promise` 
```
{
const onSubmit = async (e)=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    try{
    const auth = getAuth();
    const userCredential = await
    signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password) //and if successful then
    if(userCredential.user){ //if userCredential.user this is a truthy statement
        navigate("/") // navigate to the homepage, make sure to make the navigate function
    }
    }catch(error){
        toast.error("Bad user credentials")
    }
}
}
```

c.  `git add .` git add all
`git commit -m "complete the sign in functionality"`
`git push`
