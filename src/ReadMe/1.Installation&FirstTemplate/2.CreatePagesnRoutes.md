1. inorder to create the pages and routes in Reactjs we will use a package called react router.
2. we need to install two packages, the first one is react router, `npm i react-router` and the other is `react-router-dom` put them both in the terminal and install them together.
3. inside src we'll create a folder called pages and put all the pages there. We'll first create a Home.jsx inside of our pages folder, and inside the Home.jsx we'll create a react functional component. As we have installed ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets extension in vscode, so we just type rfc in Home.jsx and we get the structure of our functional component.
4. then we go to app.js and `import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";` as `BrowserRouter` is a bit long name we'll nickname it as `Router` .
5. inside the return statement of app.js we will return 
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home/>} />
        <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile/>} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
and we can do the same for the other pages aswell.
6. after adding all our routes, we will add our updated project in the github repository using the command
`git add . `
then we'll create a message `git commit -m "create pages and routes"
then finally we can push everything to github using `git push` and this will automatically push it to our existing github repository.
