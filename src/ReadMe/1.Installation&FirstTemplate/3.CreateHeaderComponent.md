1. In the final version we'll have a header with a logo and three buttons, Home, Offers, Sign in and we want this header to be persistent no matter which page we browse, we want the header to stay. we can do that by putting the header component below <Router> instead of nesting it inside <Routes> .

2. The structure of your header will be as follows, <div> will have a <header> nested inside it, the <header> will two other <div> 's nested inside of it. 
we'll have the first <div> that covers the entire width of the header, and then we'll have another div that is called <header> which covers from the start of the realtor logo till Home,Offers and Signin.
then the next two <div> , one will cover the realtor logo till the middle of the <header> and the other <div> will cover Home Offers Signin from the middle of the <header>. we would be able to achieve the alignments using flexbox or other methods.

3. a. we can get the realtor logo from its website, click on copy image link and past it inside our <Header />'s first <div> inside of img tag with src being the link that we copied. When we add the realtor logo link it takes the whole width of the page so using tailwind classes we change its size eg ``className='h-5 cursor-pointer'`` this in css means height 20px. we also added cursor pointer inside the tailwind class.
we will add our menu items Home, Offers, Signin using <ul> and 3 <li>.
3. b. Now we wanna bring the Home,Offers... to the right side, inorder to bring the realtor logo and the menu next to each other in the <header className='flex justify-between'> we can change the display to flex and justify-between which is same as justify-content space-between in css, then we will use the property `items-center` which brings the logo exactly at the center of our menu items Home, Offers etc.
items-center is the same as align-items:center in css. then we'll have a little bit padding `px-3` which is equal to 12px in css, px means padding in x axis or horizontally.
3. c. for bigger screens, i want to have more padding for the logo and the menu items, we can just say in tailwind classes `max-w-6xl` 6xl is 1152px in css. now we can see the padding but the logo aswell as the menu items are not in the center ,we have more padding space on the right side, we can simply fix that by saying `mx-auto` meaning margin-left margin-right auto . Now we can see the padding is evenly distributed before the logo and after the menu items and both of them are centered.
3. d. Next i wanna bring the menu next to each other instead of being vertically aligned or in the y axis. In order to bring them next to each other we need to change the display to flex in the parent, these menu items are <li> and their parent is <ul> so in <ul className="flex"> now they're next to each other, but they're connected, so we wanna set them apart with <ul className="space-x-10"> this is css equivalent to margin right and left with some values.
3. e. If you look at the final version there is a line with a shadow underneath our logo and menu items, so inorder to achieve that we'll go to our <div> with is the parent of <header className= "bg-white border-b shadow-sm sticky top-0 z-50"> and put the following tailwind classes, check header tag.
`bg-white` = bg color white , `border-b` = border bottom 1px, `shadow-sm` = small shadow , `sticky` = we want the Header to stick to the top of the page when we browse the page, `top-0` = we say it to stick at the top, `z-50` = inorder to be sure that we achieve that we will set the z-index to 50 , initially the z-index of everything is 0 and if you put it 1 it will get higher priority and it will go to the top and if you put the z-index as -1 it will go under it, so inorder to be sure that our Header is always at the top we choose a big z-index number.

4. a. Now its time to style the Menu, Initially the color of the Menu text is grey, but when we click on any Menu item, the text becomes darker than other Menu items, and the bottom of the clicked Menu item will have a red border beneath it. Inorder to achieve this logic, we should get the location of the url of the Menu items, eg /Offers, /Home . In ReactJs there is a simple way to do that , React Router DOM provides us with something called useLocation and with that we can get the location of the path.
4. b. So inside Header.jsx we import useLocation from react-router-dom, in order to use useLocation we have to initialize it so we'll put it inside a variable `const location = useLocation()` it is a function hence the parenthesis, now if we `console.log(location)` we will get objects, if we are in the Home page we will get in the objects path name '/' and if we click on sign in we get the objects path name as '/sign-in' , if we `console.log(location.pathname)` we will directly get the path consoled and whatever we write after the / in our browser address bar we will get consoled log that text in pathname.
4. b. Now that we've got the path name we can simply style this menu based on the pathname, so in Header.jsx we can see our Menu items are inside <li> so we'll add a class name inside the ``<li className={`py-3 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-400 border-b-[3px] border-b-transparent`}>Home</li>`` , we'll be using js expressions hence the curly braces and back ticks, first we give `py-3` = padding in y axis as 3 , `text-sm` = the size of the text as small, `font-semibold` = we'll make the font to semi bold , `text-gray-400` = we'll keep the clicked or active menu item as gray , `border-b-[3px]` = we'll keep the border as 3px , the reason we used square brackets for 3px is that, in tailwind there is no default option for 3px, `border-b-transparent` = we dont want the border to be shown below, so we'll make it as transparent.
4. c. Now that we're done with the basic design, we'll set the logic , in the logic we wanna say if the pathname matches this Home or the /, then just make this Home that is clicked darker than rest of the Menu items and also add the border bottom red color. so we can add a js expression using ``${}`` , but before that we wanna make a function at the top, we name the function as `pathMatchRoute(route)` and give it a parameter `route` and this will be the logic inside the function body `{if(route === location.pathname){return true}}` so if whatever route we're inside is equal to location.pathname which we get using useLocation are the same, if in route we are inside / and location.pathname gives us / aswell that means we are inside the active menu item. Now getting back to our Js expression ``${pathMatchRoute}`` we'll add that function `pathMatchRoute("/" && "text-black border-b-red500")` this is a truthy statement , if this is true then we'll add some tailwind css classes, check above code. Next we'll do the same thing for Offers and Sign in.

5. a. There's another hook(special react function) in react-router-dom called use navigate , we can use to navigate inside the website, so we'll first `import { useNavigate}` then we'll create another variable `const navigate = useNavigate() ` , now we can use the `navigate` variable to navigate around our website, for eg: if we click on the logo we go to Home, if we click on offers we go to offers page, without page refreshes, that the gist of SPA. then inside of our <div> that contains the <img> we use the `onClick` event handler by calling the `navigate` function that is returned by `useNavigate` . ``onClick={()=> navigate("/")}`` so in the onClick event handler we'll use a js expression {} and use an arrow function that returns the navigate function with the argument Home page / .

6. then we will `git add .` ". means all" so git add all, then we'll create a comment or message using `git commit -m "create the header component"` , the we will `git push` to push to github.
