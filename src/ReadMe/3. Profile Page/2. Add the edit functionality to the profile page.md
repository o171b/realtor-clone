Make sure to import all these, because of this i spent 30 minutes to debug the code
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router';
import { getAuth, updateProfile  } from 'firebase/auth';
import { toast } from "react-toastify";
import { doc, updateDoc } from 'firebase/firestore';
import {db} from "../firebase";

a. Now that we've protected the `profile` page in the previous section, In this section we'll complete the `edit` functionality in the profile page. When we click on `edit` we should have the ability to change the `name` in the profile and we wanna have the ability to `submit` this change to `firestore` . 

b. We need to go to `profile.jsx` and for the `<span>` that is saying `edit` we'll add an `onClick={() => setChangeDetail((prevState)=> !prevState)}` and then we'll go on the top and create a `hook` and we say `const [changeDetail, setChangeDetail]= useState(false)` so initially it will be false means nothing is changed, but when we click on the `edit` button we wanna make it opposite that is `true` , hence initial state is `prevState` and the later state is the opposite of or prevState that is `!prevState` . And then instead of just showing `Edit` we wanna make it dynamic like this `{changeDetail ? "Apply Change" : "Edit"}` , so if `changeDetail` which is truthy is true meaning `Edit` is clicked then dynamically change `Edit` to `Apply Change` otherwise leave it unchanged to be `Edit` .
note : i got an error because of the `onClick` because it was `onClick={setChangeDetail((prevState)=> !prevState)}` which means it gets called infinitely, so i wrapped it inside a function. check above code.

c. Now, when the `changeDetail` is `true` we wanna change the style of the `input` containing the `name` we wanna make it with background red and also the instead of `disabled` we wanna make `display={!changeDetail}` the opposite of  changeDetail, so if `false` its disabled and when its `true` its enabled, if you click on the input box now you can find it enabled, but we cannot change it yet, so we need to provide an onChange event handler `onChange={onChange}` and this onChange will call a function called onChange so lets create it at the top, so before the return statement make this function `const onChange = (e)=> {setFormData((prevState)=>{(...prevState, [e.target.id]: e.target.value,}))}` so this function is going to get the event `e` then we need to set the formData and we get the previous state and then we need to return an object `{}` in the object we wanna keep the previous state so we need to spread `...` the previous state and we just say if the `e.target.id` which is the id="name" and id="email" and this one should be equal to `:` e.target.value , so whatever the value changed will be applied to `setFormData` so we'll be updating the `name` and `email` in the `setFormData` hook when we click on `edit` .  
```
{
const onChange = (e) => {
    setFormData((prevState) => ({
      ...prevState,
      [e.target.id]: e.target.value
    }));
  };
}
```
Now we can edit the form but when we click on `apply change` and refresh the page the change doesnt happen because we didnt submit the form to the database.



d. Now we'll make the background color to be dynamic, so when clicked it will changed to red color, so in the input with the id="name" lets put all the className inside a {``} , check below for the code
```
{
className={`mb-6 w-full px-4 py-2 text-xl text-gray-700 bg-white border border-gray-300
          rounded transition ease-in-out mt-3 ${changeDetail && "bg-red-200 focus:bg-red-200"}`}
}
```
add a variable ${changeDetail}
if changeDetail is true we wanna change the background color to red and also we wanna have the focus to have a background color red , now when we click on edit we see the bg color or `name` turned red color and when we focus its red aswell.


e. Now we need to apply the `onSubmit` so inside the `onClick` and instead of returning `setChangeDetail` directly lets return in curly braces `{}` as we'll return an object put `setChangeDetail` after `ChangeDetail && onSubmit()` and we wanna return two things, if `changeDetail` is true we wanna call a function called onSubmit `&& onSubmit()` .
the reason we put the code inside {} and not () is because we're defining blocks of code that should be executed together.

```
{

onClick={() => {
                    changeDetail && onSubmit();
                    setChangeDetail((prevState)=> !prevState);
                    }}

}
```
so if changeDetail is true we're gonna submit the form.
Now before the return statement we'll make an `onSubmit()` function, with this function we're going to add the change to `database` .

```
{
 const onSubmit = async ()=>{
    try{
        if(auth.currentUser.displayName !== name){
            await updateProfile(auth.currentUser, {
                displayName: name,
            });
        const docRef = doc(db, "users", auth.currentUser.uid)
        await updateDoc(docRef,{
          name,
        });
        }
        toast.success("Profile details updated")

    }catch(error){
        toast.error("Could not update profile details")
    }

}
}
```
inside the `onSubmit` function we wanna add `try` and `catch` statement and for the error, we wanna `toast` notify it from react-toastify and in the error we could say "Could not update profile details" and inside the try block {} we wanna first check if the name is changed or not so we say if `auth.currentUser.displayName ! == name` then we wanna submit the change, this `onSubmit` function will return a promise so we need to make it `async` , then we `await` `updateProfile()` which is coming from `firebase/auth` and this is getting the current user `updateProfile(auth.currentUser,)` and we just wanna change the `displayName` to `:name`  that is coming from the `formData` . 

After that inside the try block we wanna update the name in fireStore, inside the fireStore first we need to create a reference we can call it `const docRef=doc(db, "users", auth.currentUser.uid)` = we need to use the `doc` method which is coming from `fireStore` this is going to take three things `db` `the collection name` `userId` so we've created the reference and now we can use this reference to update the document. We're gonna use a function from fireStore which is gonna return a promise so we need to use await, `await` = and then we just say ` await updateDoc(docRef,{name,});` which is coming from `firebase/firestore` and this is going to take two things `docRef` and the second thing is the change we wanna apply which is the `name,` which is coming from `formData` . lastly we wanna say `toast.success("Profile details updated")` .
Now try to change the name and hit refresh you can see the name changes.

Lastly add to github.
