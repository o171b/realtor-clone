In the last section we've looped through the listings and showed it in the profile page in the My Listings section and also we've created a component for each of them. This is how the final listing will look like , we've an image at the top , and this component is relative and inside the image we've the day of the post `a month ago` that is gonna be positioned `absolute` on the top left, then we have the map pin logo and next to it is the address and the address is truncated if it exceeds the size of the component, then we've the name of the property which is truncated aswell, then we've the the prize of the property then we've the number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms and finally we've the `pencil` logo for editing our post and delete button to delete the post and they will have the position `absolute` aswell as they'll always have to be in the bottom right of the component.

a. we go to `ListingItem.jsx` in the return statement instead of putting our code in a <div> container we'll put it inside a <li> , its good for search engines, and we delete whatever is there inside the div
```
{
<div>
    {listing.name}
    {listing.description}
    </div>

This code we gonna delete
}
```

b. Then inside the <li> we'll put a child tag <Link> which is coming from react-router-dom, we'll import that, for auto import you can put the cursor inside the <Link> and press ctrl+space. this link is going to the address of the listing where its posted, and because its dynamic
we add curly braces and backticks so this goes to category then we add a variable for listing
${listing.type} and then we add a / and we need to add the id of the listing ${id}

c. Inside the list first we add an image tag and now if we go to our website, we can see
that the images start showing, and if we click on the image this is the address we get
`http://localhost:5173/category/rent/4IgNY09GbxyG3hsCGzRb` . so after the image we're gonna
add the time when it was posted `a month ago` , and this is dynamic and we need to get it
from firestore. when we go to firestore database and the listing we can see that we have
timestamp and it shows 17 august 2023, but we dont wanna use this one, we just wanna show
how many minutes ago, hours ago , days ago or months ago the listing was posted. so in order to
do that we're gonna use a package called moment. so google react moment and npm it, then check
package.json to see if the package is installed. now after the image we say <Moment></Moment>.
note: Instead of Moment i used `luxon`, as i was getting an error with Moment and Moment wont be supported
anymore.

d. after the date since posted we're gonna create the address, and i need to get the pin address
icon, so we've to go to react icons.com, and search for location on after importing it, we create a div
after the div that has the formattedDate variable, and inside that div we create one more div
and paste <MdLocation /> and you should see the location icon now and inside the child the same
child div that has the icon we create a <p> for the listing address then we comeout of the
child div, inside the parent div we create a <p> for listing description
Then we wanna show if there is an offer we'll show the discounted price, if not we'll show the 
regular price so we'll use conditional operators ? then we add a comma , after every three
digits using regular expressions. Then we say `{listing.type === "rent" && " / month" }` if listing.type is equal to rent then we wanna show / month. Then we'll create the part that says number of beds and baths, so we just put them inside a parent div which will have a child div and inside the child div a paragraph and we put this code in the paragraph `<p>{listing.bedrooms > 1 ? `${listing.bedrooms} Beds` : "1 Bed"}</p>` so if the bedrooms are more than one we return plural Beds and if there is a single bedroom we return singule Bed. and we can use the same code for bathrooms with slight change we add another div with a paragraph for the bathroom, so the structure will be a parent div with two child divs one for the bed and the other for the bath and each one containing a paragraph, when we put both of them inside a parent div, it will help us bring both the child divs next to each other using flexbox.

e. Next we'll add styling for our components using tailwind css starting from the top <li>

f. after styling in the ListingItem.jsx we go to profile.jsx were we have the mapping of our listings inside a <ul> and we style it using tailwind using grid.

g. then we add to github
git add .
