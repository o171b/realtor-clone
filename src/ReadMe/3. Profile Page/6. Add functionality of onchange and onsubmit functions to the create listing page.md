import React from 'react'
import { useState } from 'react';
import Spinner from "../components/Spinner"
import { toast } from "react-toastify"
import { getStorage, ref, uploadBytesResumable, getDownloadURL } from "firebase/storage"
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth"
import {v4 as uuid4} from "uuid";
import {serverTimestamp} from "firebase/firestore;

a. In the previous section we created the UI of the listings page, and we created a `onChange` function, but we didn't complete it, Now we'll complete that. In the `onChange` function we need to have some `conditions` because we have inputs like `true and false` we've `numbers` and we also have `files` and `text` from name and address input.
```
{
 const onChange = (e)=>{
    let boolean = null;
    if (e.target.value === "true"){
        boolean = true;
    }
    if(e.target.value === "false"){
        boolean = false;
    }
    if(e.target.files){
        setFormData((prevState)=>({
            ...prevState,
            images: e.target.files
        }));
    }
    if(!e.target.files){
        setFormData((prevState)=>({
            ...prevState,
            [e.target.id]: boolean ?? e.target.value,
        }))
    }

 }
}
```
//we need to create a variable called `boolean` with a default value of null and we can use it to change the state in `formData`, as our create listing page contains either selections or text boxes , so we want for the selections to be either true or false, and for the text boxes the value to be null.
//the if statement is self explanatory , it will compare the value that we've given down in the code, for eg: for the offer button we've give a value={true} so `e.target.value` compares that value with either `true` or `false` .
//There is another situation if the input is files. so we want our event handler to target files `e.target.files`, so we use the setter function `setFormData` which takes `prevState` and returns a state object with the updated images property.
// if(!e.target.files) checks if there are not files selected in the event target, setFormData takes prevState as an argument, then we have `[e.target.id]:boolean ?? e.target.value` creates a new object property with a `key equal to id` attribute of the target element and a value that is either a `boolean` or the `value of the target element` , so it first checks if the value is `true or false` and its set as default value, if it is not then the `value` is something else , may be a `string` or `number` etc. in simpler words, if `boolean` is not `null` its either `true or false` consider the first one, if the `boolean` is `null` consider the second one which is `e.target.value` .
//`e.target.files` is for files
//`!e.target.files` is for text, boolean, number

b. Now i want to make this route `protected` because we dont want anyone that is not `authorized` or `logged in with their account` to submit this form. for eg : if i copy the `/create-listing` url and then i `signout` i will still be able to access the create-listing page, which is wrong. So just as we did for the `profile` page we'll do the same in `app.js` , Now you cannot access the `/create-listing` page unless you are `signed in` .

c. Now we wanna add a functionality so that each listing has a `map` embedded in its page, and has its latitude and longitude , but we need a bank card to access this google map `api` , but we'll add this functionality manually if we dont have a bank card. So inside the `CreateListing.jsx` we'll add a `geolocation hook` and this is going to be false by default so we can add it manually but in case if you have a bank card you can switch it to `true` . so at the top after the `createListing()` we add `const [geoLocationEnabled, setGeoLocationEnabled] = useState(false);` and then add it to the `formData` hook `latitude: 0` 0 as default, `longitude: 0` and we'll destructure it aswell . Now we can use them in our `form` so after the `address` i wanna add them. So im going to add a condition
```
{
    {!geoLocationEnabled &&(
            <div className='flex space-x-6 justify-start mb-6'>
                <div className=''>
                    <p>Latitude</p>
                    <input type="number" 
                    id="latitude" 
                    value={latitude} 
                    onChange={onChange}
                    required
                    min="-90"
                    max="90"
                    className='w-full px-4 py-2 text-xl text-gray-700 bg-white border
                    border-gray-300 rounded transition duration-150 ease-in-out focus:bg-white
                    focus:text-gray-700 focus:border-slate-600 text-center'
                     />
                </div>
                <div className=''>
                    <p>Longitude</p>
                    <input type="number" 
                    id="longitude" 
                    value={longitude} 
                    onChange={onChange}
                    required
                    min="-180"
                    max="180"
                    className='w-full px-4 py-2 text-xl text-gray-700 bg-white border
                    border-gray-300 rounded transition duration-150 ease-in-out focus:bg-white
                    focus:text-gray-700 focus:border-slate-600 text-center'
                     />
                </div>
            </div>
        )}
}
```

//if geoLocationEnabled api is false, then show us this div
//we've added the styling in the code block above.
//min and max for latitude and longitude are different.

and for the latitude , we just copy and paste the `latitude` code below it. and swap the values with `longitude`. and now we need to bring them next to each other. and then for the parent `<div>` that wraps both the `longitude` and `latitude` divs we give it a tailwind class see code above.
then we make `enabledGeoLocation` to `false`

d. Now in our `<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>` tag we'll add an `onSubmit` event listener. So just after `onChange()` we're going to add another function `onSubmit()`
```
{
    const onSubmit = (e)=> {
        e.preventDefault();
        setLoading(true);

    }
}
```


e. Also i wanna have some loading effect so when we click on `create-listing` we're going to have this spinner and all the data is going to be uploaded to the database and after everything is done we wanna stop the spinner and we're going to redirect the person to that particular page, so we're going to add a new hook after geoLocation hook called `loading` hook. After the `geoLocation` hook we'll add another hook and we'll call it `loading, setLoading = useState(false);` and we make it to false, and if the loading is `true` we wanna show a spinner instead of the `form` page. And before the return statement we put this code
```
{
    if(loading){
        return <Spinner />;
    }
}
```
//then after everything is finished and uploaded to the database we add this line in `onSubmit` after `preventDefault()` , this one `setLoading(true)`

f. After the `setLoading` we wanna check some conditions, for eg: we've the `offer` which has a `yes` and `no` buttons, and when we click on `yes` we want the `regular` price to be more than the discounted `price` , for eg: if we select the regular price as 53 we want the discounted price to be less than 53. So we add this code inside `onSubmit()`
```
{
    if(discountedPrice >= regularPrice){
            setLoading(false)
            toast.error("Discounted price should be less than Regular price")
            return ;
        }
{/* if discounted price is greater than or equal to regular price then we dont want
the loading animation to play instead we want the toast to display an error
and then we return the function if the condition is true
*/}
}
```

After that we'll return another condition for the `file upload` we want the maximum images to be `6` if it is more thn `6` we'll return an error. so first we'll add `images:{}` to our `formData` hook above then we destructure it `images` then we use the below code for the conditional `if statement`
```
{
    if (images.length > 6){
            setLoading(false);
            toast.error("Maximum 6 images are allowed")
            return;
        }
}
```

After that for geoLocation , so first we create a variable `let geoLocation = {}` and we create another variable `let location` and this is the location we get from `google api` .
```
{
    let geoLocation = {}
    let location
    if (geoLocationEnable){
        const response = await fetch(`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=${address}&key=${process.env.REACT_APP_GEOCODE_API_KEY}`) //we need to convert the onSubmit() to async as we're using promises with await
        const data = await response.json()
        console.log(data)


    }
{/*
    1. if geoLocationEnabled which is truthy , is true we wanna fetch data from the google api.
    2. to get this we need to go to google and search for "console google cloud" on the top click on
    "realtor-clone" then click on "All" tab and select "realtor-clone" and search for "geocoding"
    and in the result you'll get "geocoding api" click on it and click on "Enable"
    then click on "Enabled apis and services" and you'll find it enabled. And when you click on Manage
    it'll ask for credit card details.
    Note: for google maps api, you need credit/debit card verification.
    Otherwise you can manually fill in the longitude/latitude as we have in our form.
    so if you put your card details you get an "api key"
    3. copy the api key and go to vscode and create a file outside of everything, src, public etc and
    call it .env.local and write "REACT_APP_GEOCODE_API_KEY= API KEY" put the api key without quotes.
    4. we're going to create a response and the response is going to await and we're going to fetch
    the api, as we're using await we need to make the onSubmit() as async.
    5. then we put the address for the fetch and as it is dynamic so we put backticks 
    fetch(`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/
    geocode/json?address=${address}&key=${process.env.REACT_APP_GEOCODE_API_KEY}`) , 
    and we're going to get the json , then we add a question mark because we wanna add some queries,
    first query is the address and the address is coming from the address that we've in the formData hook, we
    put the variable in ${} as its a variable after that we add another query which is our api key so we add another
    variable which is our api key.
    6. after that we get the data which is equal to await and we convert the data that we're getting into json, 
    so the response is converted into json "response.json()"
    7. after that restart the server otherwise you will get invalid api key error which
    we saved in the env variable,  and console.log(data)
    8. i got an error so i added the following line to vite.config.js
    define: {
    'process.env': {}
  }
  but anyway the api key was wrong

*/}
}
```

g. When we console.log(data), we can an object called `geometry` and it has `lat` as key with `-27.4650982` as value and `lng` as key with `153.0204318` as value, Now we can use this data to fill our form and we're gonna add this data to the database aswell. In the form if you put the wrong address we get an error for eg: we put `aldfjal` as address we get the `status:'ZERO_RESULTS'` . Later we wanna show the user that the address is incorrect if we get `ZERO_RESULTS` 

we have already created a variable `let geoLocation = {};` and now we can fill it, we just say
```
{
    geolocation.lat = data.results[0]?.geometry.location.lat ?? 0;
    geolocation.lng = data.results[0]?.geometry.location.lng ?? 0;

    location = data.status === "ZERO_RESULTS" && undefined;

    if (location === undefined || location.includes("undefined")){
        setLoading(false);
        toast.error("please enter a correct address");
        return;
    }else{
        geolocation.lat = latitude;
        geolocation.lng = longitude;
    }


{/* 1. geolocation.lat is equal to the data we get which is inside the results at the first
    array if this one exists then .? we use optional chaining we wanna get the lat,lng property from 
    .geometry.location.lat  , or we use the nullish operator ?? if its null we wanna have 0 instead 
    2. we copy the same code for the longitude*/}
    3. results is an object we get which has an array[] inside it when we console.log(data)
    4. Now that we have the geoLocation lat and lng we can set the location we have in the variable
    `let location` 
    5. we say location is equal to data.status is equal to "ZERO_RESULTS" if its true we set the location
    to undefined
    6. and if this error happens , if the location is equal to undefined || or if the location includes
    these words ("undefined") first we set the loading to false and we wanna toast an error saying
    ("please enter a correct address") after this we wanna return and we dont wanna continue this
    function.
    7. if (typeof location === "string" && location.includes("undefined")) i got an error so i changed
    the above code to this.
    8. But the problem with the code is that i was unable to connect to an api, so i didnt get
    the object that the api gives in console.log(data)
    9. if we get the api setup, we should get in the toast enter a correct address when we enter a wrong
    address
    10. else if we dont have the bank card and we dont have access to the google maps api we make the
    geolocation hook to (false) and we get the fields for latitude and longitude
*/}

h. for the images we create a new variable and call it `const imgUrls = await Promise.all
```
{
    const storeImage = async (image)=>{
        return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
            const storage = getStorage()
            const fileName = `${auth.currentUser.uid}-${image.name}`
            const storageRef = ref(storage, fileName);

        })

    }


       const imgUrls = await Promise.all(
            [...images]
            .map((image) => storeImage(image)))
            .catch((error) => {
                setLoading(false);
                toast.error("Images not uploaded");
                return;
            }
            
        );
            console.log(imgUrls)
}
```
{/*
1. we create a variable and call it imgUrls and we're going to await and we create a Promise and for all the images we're going to actually loop through the images and put them inside [...images] so we say [...images].map this is going to give us each image (image) then we're going to upload each image by calling a function storeImage and we pass that image to this function , so with map we get each image and use the function storeImage to store it.
2. And if its successful then fine, but if its not then we catch an error and we setLoading as false and throw a toast error. 
3. we put this code inside onSubmit() just like the above code for geoLocation.
4. and above const imgUrls we'll create a function and we call it storeImage and we'll this make this function async
5. Then lets search on google how to upload images, so we search for "firebase image upload to cloud storage"
6. Then under Monitor upload progress we can find a code snippet with instructions on how the upload process works in firebase.
7. So inside the storeImage() we're going to return a new Promise and this is going to give us two things new Promise((resolve,reject)) resolve is when its successful and reject is when we get an error.
8. And this function is going to return => and first things we're going to get the storage which we can get using getStorage() method so we're going to import {getStorage, ref, uploadBytesResumable, getDownloadURL} from "firebase/storage";
9. so after getting the storage we define the file name const fileName, but instead of 'images/rivers.jpg' which we have in the documentation our file name is dynamic so we'll use back ticks `${auth.currentUser.uid}-${image.name}` and first thing we wanna see who uploads the image we get get this one using auth.currentUser.uid but we'll get an error because we dont have the auth, so we'll create the auth at the very top before our hooks `const auth = getAuth()` and we'll import it "import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth" , then we use inside the constfileName another variable which is ${image.name} we seperate both the variables with a dash - , and the third variable just in case if the user uploads the same image twice , so we'll install a package called `uuid` , so open a terminal and install the package using `npm i uuid`
10. Then we import uuid version 4 so we say import {v4 as uuid4} from "uuid"; uuid version v4 is the most commonly used version we for ease of use we name it as uuid4 and its a function.
11. so in const fileName = `${auth.currentUser.uid}-${image.name}-${uuidv4()}` ,  so we add our third variable uuid4 which is a function.
12. Then for storeRef this method we can find it on firebase we copy the line `const storageRef = ref(storage, `images/rivers.jpg`);` and paste it after const fileName, the image name is dynamic so we change `images/river.jpg` to `fileName` that we created above.
13. after the `const storageRef` we need to add that upload task. so we copy it from firebase website and paste it `const uploadTask = uploadBytesResumable(storageRef, image); , we replace file in the parameter with image as we've the image above as parameter in our storeImage(image) function.
14. Then we'll paste the uploadTask.on() method from the firebase website. The only changes we need to make in the code is in the error block we put this `reject(error)` , and also in getDownloadURL insead of console logging we're going to replace it with `resolve(downloadURL)`
15. Now we'll test our const imgUrls function by console logging it and see if the images get uploaded. so after uploading an image in our form and going to firebase console and storage we can see the image has been uploaded. when your images are uploading successfully in firebase just comment out console log. 
*/}

i. Now we need to add image url and geolocation to the formData and also we wanna add the timestamp aswell and after that we can submit it to the database or firestore in our case.

```
{ 

     const formDataCopy = {
                ...formData,
                imgUrls,
                geolocation,
                timestamp: serverTimestamp(),
            };
            delete formDataCopy.images;
            !formDataCopy.offer && delete formDataCopy.discountedPrice;
            delete formDataCopy.latitude;
            delete formDataCopy.longitude;
            const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "listings",), formDataCopy);
            setLoading(false)
            toast.success("Listing created");
            navigate(`/category/${formDataCopy.type}/${docRef.id}`);


}
```
{/*
1. we create a copy of our formData = const formDataCopy , because we dont wanna change the original formData, this has to do with js passing objects as reference, we create a copy so that the original formData's data remains intact. so this is going to be equal to whatever is in our formData = ...formData, we're going to add image urls = imgUrls, we are going to add the geolocation = geolocation, and we're going to add timestamp which is going to be equal to the function timestamp() = timestamp: serverTimestamp() and we need to import it aswell and this is coming from firebase/firestore.
2. Now that we've added some data to our formDataCopy we wanna remove some aswell, refer the code above.
3. After this go to firebase and click on firestore database we can see a new document is created with the name listings and we can see inside the collection we have all the fields that we added in formData such as bedroom, furnished etc.
4. Then we'll create a variable const navigate which uses useNavigate() hook =, const navigate = useNavigate() and it is coming from react-router-dom. so we're going to navigate the person to some dynamic url so we put it inside backticks its dynamic because we want the url to be based on a listing id. so the category we wanna check if its rent or sale so we say formDataCopy.type
5. Now when we try to create a listing we get an error that discounted price needs to be less than regular price, even if our inputs are correct thats because js is defaulting to string type in our discounted and regular price comparison code block, so we need to add +discountedPrice >= +regularPrice which is a unary operator and it will convert our variables to numbers instead of strings.
6. Now when we try to create a listing we see we are redirected in the url to /category/sale , as we selected sale in our form before submitting.
7. All this code is inside the onSubmit function.
*/}

Now we'll push this to github
git add .
git commit -m "add functionality including onChange and onSubmit function to the create listing page"
git push
