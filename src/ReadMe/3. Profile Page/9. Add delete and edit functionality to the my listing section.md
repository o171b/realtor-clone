when we wanna click on the edit button we should be taken to the particular listing page where we'll be able to edit and resubmit it, for deleting when we click on it the page is going to ask our confirmation before deleting the post `Are you sure you want to delete?` . and when we're in the profile page then only the deleting and edit options should show up, and when we're in the home page they should dissapear, so we should have a condition for that.

a. Inside `Profile.jsx` we're going to add the delete and edit functions and we're going to pass it as `props` inside the <ListItem /> component. We're going to pass two things here
`onDelete={()=>onDelete(listing.id)}` = which is going to trigger a function called `onDelete()` and this onDelete function is going to take the `listing.id` so we know which id to delete. And same logic is applied for `onEdit={()=>onEdit(listing.id)}` . And then we need to create these functions. so just before the return after the useEffect we're going to create the functions. After creating the function we go to `ListingItem.jsx` and let the function receive props `onDelete` `onEdit` which already has received two props `listing` and `id` .

b. We need to get two icons, so lets go to `ReactIcons` there we search for `Edit` and `Trash` . for trash this icon `FaTrash` i wanna use so we need to import it `import { FaTrash } from 'react-icons/fa'` . for edit `import { MdEdit } from 'react-icons/md';` we're importing them in `ListingItem.jsx` .

e. After the </Link> at the bottom inside the <li> we say {onDelete && (<FaTrash />)} = if onDelete exists we're going to have this trash icon and we'll use the same logic of onEdit icon. After adding tailwindcss styling we'll add an `onClick()` which will call `onDelete()` . 
```
{
 <FaTrash className='absolute bottom-2 right-2'
        onClick = {()=>onDelete(listing.id)} />

/*
onClick will call the onDelete function that we're getting from the props and we're going to pass
listing.id
*/
}
```
copy paste the same code for onEdit and make the appropriates changes.

f. The logic of the onDelete and onEdit functions
for on Edit its simple when a user wants to edit his post he will be redirected to a dynamic page as it depends on the id of the listing so we add a back tick and we get the parameter listingID from the prop and we're going to redirect the user to a page called edit-listing and to make the listing id as dynamic we'll put it in ${listingID} , Now if we click on the edit button we're navigated to the edit-listing page.
onDelete is going to get the listingId aswell as a parameter, first we wanna prompt the user if he is sure to delete the listing, so we say if(window.confirm("Are you sure you want to delete?")) . We wanna use a method called `deleteDoc` from `firestore` to delete that listing. so we're gonna use `await` because its returning a promise and we wanna change this `onDelete` function to `async`, and we're going to `await` for `deleteDoc`, and this `deleteDoc(doc)` is going to get doc, and this `doc` is going to take three things `doc()` the `db` , the collection name which in our case is `"listings"` and the id which is coming from the props `listingID` . 
After deleting the listing we need to update the `let listing = []` the listing array so we'll create a variable called `const updatedListings` and we're going to filter our listings ` = listings.filter((listing)=>)` the filter is going to give us each listing and we wanna keep everything except for the listingID. After that we're going to update the hook with the updated listings, `setListings(updatedListings)` and finally we wanna toast a success saying ("successfully deleted listing")
