a. In the `pages folder` we're going to create a file called `EditListing.jsx` and then we'll rfc into it and similar to `createlisting.jsx` we wanna make this page as `protected` , so that unauthorized person cannot access this page. So we can go to `App.js` and copy the create listing route and its protected route and copy them down.
```
{
<Route path='/edit-listing' element={<PrivateRoute />} >
        <Route path='/edit-listing/:listingId' element={<EditListing />} />
        </Route>
}
```

b. Edit listing page and create listing page are similar so we copy the create listing page code and paste it in edit listing page. but we need to make slight changes to this page, we wanna fetch the data of the listing from the firestore database , edit the data and update it in the firestore database.
just after the `formData` destructure we'll create a useEffect hook
```
{
    useEffect(()=>{
        setLoading(true); //this will display the spinner
        const fetchListing = async ()=>{
            const docRef = doc(db, "listings", listingId)
        }
        fetchListing();
        
    },[]);

//this useEffect hook is going to return a function and the dependecy we'll just leave it
empty.
//inside the function we'll use the setLoading(true)
//then we need to fetch the listing, as the fetchListing is an async function,
so we need to create it and call it 
//inside the body of the fetchListing() we need to create a reference for that listing,
//the reference is going to use the doc and we need the id of the listing which we can see in the
//listings url
//so we create the reference or the address const `docRef` and this is going to get the doc
//which is coming from firestore and the doc takes three things (db, "listings", params.listingId) database, collection name, then the id
//we can use the `useParams` to get the id from the url, so above the useEffect hook we'll create a const params = useParams()
//Now that we've the reference we need to get the snapshot of the data from firestore and we'll call it
`const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);` = we just get the getDoc and this is going to get that reference or address (docRef)
//Now that we have the docSnap, we say if docSnap exists , we use the exists method docSnap.exists so if it exists, we wanna set the listing `setListing` so we need to create a useState hook on top for listing,`const [listing, setListing] = useState(null);` 
//we setListing(docSnap.data()) = we set the listing to that snapshot that we're getting
//after that we're going to update the formData so we say `setFormData({...docSnap.data()}) ` so this is going to be an object, and in this object we'll add all snapshot data ...docSnap.data() then after the setFormData we'll set the loading to false `setLoading(false)` for the else block, if the `listing` doesnot exist we navigate the person to the home page and toast an error
}
```

c. Now that when we click on the edit button we get the data that we can edit, but the button functionality is still the same `create listing` so we wanna change it to `edit listing`.
so above if(loading){return <spinner />} we have the variable const docRef, we need to edit it to `const docRef = doc(db, "listings", params.listingId);` `await updateDoc(docRef, formDataCopy);`

d. Then we need to change the button name instead of `Create Listing` we'll change it to `Edit Listing` and also the toast message.

e. The other things we need to consider ,the person who is editing the listing its not enough for him to authorize the listing, this way any authorized user can edit the listing of other users, so we just want the owner of the page to edit his listings only. so we need to add another `useEffect()` hook after the first useEffect hook that we created.
```
{

useEffect(()=>{
  if(listing && listing.userRef !== auth.currentUser.uid){
    toast.error("You can't edit this listing")
    navigate("/")
  }
},[auth.currentUser.uid, listing])

//if listing exists and if the id inside the listing userRef is not equal to the the id we're getting from the authentication, then we just wanna toast an error saying ("you cannot edit this listing") then we can navigate the person to the homepage navigate("/")

}
```

now copy the link for the edit page and sign in with another account and pasted it , you will be toasted with an error you can't edit this list.

lets add it to github
git add .
git commit -m "create edit listing page"
git push
