a. In this section we'll add the `spinner` loading component to our project. Firstly, we'll create a component in the `components` folder and call it `Spinner.jsx` and we'll `rfc` into it, inside the `div` we'll create another `div` and it will have an image tag `<img= src="" alt="" />`, the spinner will be an `.svg` file. You can search in google `loader generator` or just go to the website `https://loading.io` and select one of the free loading images, i will choose the one that look like a square. click on it and choose its color and make sure to toggle the `transparency to on`  and download it as an `svg` and click on `animated` . Inside the `src` folder create another folder and call it `assets` and inside assets create a folder called `svg` and put the downloaded image inside it and rename it to `spinner`. Then we need to import it at the top `import spinner from "../assets/svg/spinner.svg"` and in src we need to add it `src={spinner}` and for `alt="Loading..."` and for the styling i will `className="h-24"` to make it smaller.

b. Inside the `PrivateRoute.jsx` instead of just saying `Loading` in the return statement we'll put the spinner component `<Spinner />` and make sure to import it `import Spinner from './Spinner';` . Now when you try to refresh the page you can see the spinner loading effect on the top left part of the page, so we need to style it.

c. so inside `Spinner.jsx` , give the first div a className `<div className="bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center fixed left-0 right-0 bottom-0 top-0 z-50">` = we wanna make it to the center so we say `flex` and use `items-center` and `justify-center` to bring it to the center horizontally and vertically and make the position `fixed` and bring it to 0 from left,right,bottom,top `left-0` `right-0` `bottom-0` `top-0` so its exactly at the center, and make the z-index to be 50 `z-50`, if you remember we already gave the `Header.jsx` a z index of 50 so lets change the Headers z index to 40 first.
