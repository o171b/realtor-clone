1. 
a. if we go to our website `realtor-clone.com/profile` we'll be redirected to signin page because we're not authorized to see the  `profile` page unless we `login`, It means the `profile` page is protected.
This might be the most difficult part in the project and the most important also.

b. go to `Profile.jsx` , and after the return statement put react fragments `<> </>` and put a `<section>` tag and inside of it an `<h1>` tag and write `My Profile` and style it with tailwind `<h1 className="text-3xl text-center mt-6 font-bold"> My Profile</h1>` , `mt-6` = margin top 6 to bring the text `My Profile` a bit down. then we will put a `div` tag and inside it a `form` tag and inside the `form` we're gonna have two inputs, one for the `name` and one for the `email` , for the `name` we have `<input type="text" id="name" value={name} disabled className="mb-6 w-full px-4 py-2 text-xl text-gray-700 bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded transition ease-in-out">` we dont have the `value={name}` at the moment so we'll create it at the top before the `return` statement. The initial value comes from `firebase authentication` but for now we'll hard code it. So we'll create a `useState hook` `const [formData, setFormData] = react.useState({name: "Omair", email: "umair55ecs@gmail.com"})` then we'll `destructure` this `formData` and get the name and email `const{name, email} = formData` , so now we've access to the name. we'll make `input` as `disabled` so it cannot be changed , later we'll create an `edit` button to change it. Then we'll style it using tailwind `w-full` = input box takes 100% width of the page, `px-4` = padding , `py-2` = padding y axis . Now we can see the form, but its covering the whole width of the screen, so lets grab the parent `div` that contains `form` and give it a `<div ClassName="w-full md:w-[50%] mt-6 px-3">` , `w-full` = for the mobile size we'll make the width to be 100% , `md:w=[50%]` = then in the medium size and above lets make the width 50% , `mt-6` = brings the input box a bit down , `px-3` = pushes the boxes a bit from the edge of the screen. Now we wanna bring everything to the center, so we grab the `section` tag as it is the parent of all the tags, and give it a tailwind class `<section className="max-w-6xl flex mx-auto justify-center items-center flex-col">` , `max-w-6xl` = width to be 1152px, `flex` = make the display flex so we can flex the items vertically or horizontally, `mx-auto` = margin to be auto, `justify-center` = make the contents in the container to be horizontally aligned, `items-center` = to bring them to the center horizontally and vertically, `flex-col` = and i want the items to be on top of each other so we change the flex direction to column. So now we have the `name` input we can copy and paste it for the `email` input do these changes `<input type='email' id='email' value={email} disabled` and lets add some `mb-6` to seperate both the input boxes, add it to both the `inputs` name and email.

c. Now we wanna add `Do you want to change your name? Edit and signout`. so after the `email input` we'll have another `div` and inside this div we'll have a `p` that says `Do you want to change your name?` and inside this paragraph we'll have a `span` and it says `Edit`. and after this paragraph we'll have another `p` that says `Sign Out` .
Now we need to style them so in the top or parent `div` we add tailwind classes `<div className="flex justify-between whitespace-nowrap text-sm sm:text-lg mb-6">` , `flex` = to bring both the `p` in the same line, `justify-between` = justify content space between to have some space between both the `p` , `whitespace-nowrap` = incase the screen gets narrow, we don't want `signout` to go to the next line , `text-sm` = text small in narrow screens, `sm:text-lg` = make the text large as you increase the width of the screen, `mb-6` = we wanna have some margin or space at the bottom so they we can place a button or some text and there will be space,

d. for the first `<p className="flex items-center">` we can add a tailwind class, `flex items-center` = so they will be always centered in the same line, now for the `<span className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-700 transition ease-in-out duration-200 ml-1 cursor-pointer">` . For the next `<p className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 transition duration-200 ease-in-out cursor-pointer">Signout</p>`

e. Now, instead of `hardcoding` the `formData` we wanna get the real name of the person who is authenticated , so the way is to get current user data from the `auth` from `firebase authentication` and show the current user data from that `auth` , we can do this, but we're gonna get an error because the `profile page` is going to be rendered before getting the information from the `firebase`, so the `name` and `email` that is fetched from `formData` is going to be empty . So lets test it and see the error, then we're going to fix it by adding the `middleware` that always checks that the persons `login` information is already exists in `profile` page and then show them inside the input boxes `name` and `email`. so in the `profile.jsx` inside `export default function Profile(){const auth = getAuth()}` we add `const auth` part as the first line in the `Profile` function, as we already know `getAuth()` comes from `firebase/auth` so we need to import `getAuth` aswell . And instead of hardcoding `name:"omair"` and `email:"something@gmail.com"` we change it to `name: auth.currentUser.displayName` and for the email `email: auth.currentUser.email` . But after adding these lines, the `profile` page goes blank and when we open the console we see an error `Uncaught TypeError: cannot read properties of null(reading 'displayName' )` that is because the `profile` page is rendering before getting the `auth` data from `firebase` . we'll fix this next , this is just to show the logic behind how we can `redirect` to `signin` page and checking the `authentication` and adding the `loading/checking effect`.

f. To fix the above error, Inside the `components` folder lets create a file and call it `PrivateRoute.jsx` .
In `PrivateRoute.jsx` we `rfc` inside it to get our `PrivateRoute` functional component, 
```
{
import React from 'react'
import { outlet, Navigate} from "react-router-dom"

export default function PrivateRoute() {
  return (
    const loggedIn = false; 
    return loggedIn ? <Outlet /> : <Navigate to =  "/sign-in" />; 
  )
}
}
```
//lets create a dummy variable `const loggedIn` and set it to `false` value, later we're going to get this false and true from firebase, for now we'll just see how this system works.
//if the `loggedIn` is true we're going to return everything inside the profile page which is a private route, we do this using <Outlet /> , otherwise we wanna redirect to the `sign-in` page and we can use the `Navigate`, this `Navigate` is different from `useNavigate` hook, it just redirects the person to the places that we want.
//we need to add this `PrivateRoute` to `app.js`, inside `app.js` we need to import `PrivateRoute` 

```
{
    <Route path="/profile" element={<PrivateRoute />}>
        <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
    <Route />
}
```
//instead of just having the `Profile` path, we are going to put it inside this `<PrivateRoute />` . So we add another <Route> and we close it <Route /> and we bring the `Profile` inside it,  `Route` will have the path `path="/profile" element={<PrivateRoute />}` but the element will be that `PrivateRoute`, see the code above.
//so if the person is signedin it will render the inside of `<Profile />` using the <Outlet> otherwise it's going to navigate the person to sign-in`<Navigate to="/sign-in" />` .
// so lets try this, Now if we try to go in the `/profile` url we'll be redirected to `/sign-in` page, because we manually put the `loggedIn` as `false` in this variable `const loggedIn = false;` in `PrivateRoute.jsx` , so nobody can go to the `profile` page anymore unless they're `loggedIn` or `authorized` .

g. Instead of manually setting the variable `const loggedIn=false` we wanna create a hook and get this <Outlet /> from the `firebase` . so inside the `src` folder, we're going to create another folder and naming it `hooks` and name this hook as `useAuthStatus.jsx` we `rfc` inside it to get the `functional component` 
```
{
import React from 'react'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth'

export default function useAuthStatus() {
    const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false)
    const [checkingStatus, setCheckingStatus]=useState(true)

    useEffect(()=> {
    const auth = getAuth();
    onAuthStateChange(auth,(user)=>{
        if (user){
            setLoggedIn(true);
        }
        setCheckingStatus(false);
    });
    },[]);
  return { loggedIn, checkingStatus};
}
}
```
//so it will have an initial state and a setter function `const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false)` with an initial value of `false` .
//and also we need some time to get the information from `firebase` so we need another `hook` that checks the status whether the information was passed or not otherwise we'll add this `loading effect` . we can either call it `loading` or `checking` state, we will use `checking` here, `const [checkingStatus, setCheckingStatus]=useState(true)` and the initial value will be `true` .
// and now we wanna use `useEffect(()=>{const auth=getAuth()...})` hook to ask `firebase` if the person is authenticated or not.
`useEffect` and this `useEffect` is going to return a `function` first we need to get the `auth` initialized as `getAuth()` which is coming from `firebase/auth` , `const auth= getAuth()` , after that we're going to use another method from `firebase` called `onAuthStateChange()` , so we need to put this code after the variable `const auth` ,  and this is going to to take the `(auth)` and gives us the `(user)` , and we'll check if the user exists or not, after we're sure if the user exists or not we can set the checking status to false `setCheckingStatus(false)`, we need to add a square bracket `[]` which is a `useEffect dependecies array` which mean that we'll call the `useEffect` just one time and for returning we just `return{loggedIn, checkingStatus}` ,this is going to be the code snippet, `onAuthStateChange(auth, (user)=>{if(user){setLoggedIn(true)}setCheckingStatus(false)})},[]} return {loggedIn, checkingStatus};` . So this is the hook we're going to use inside the `PrivateRoute` . 
so lets review the code block, in `useAuthStatus()` we've added two hooks using `useState` the `loggedIn` is set to `false` by default but we'll set it to `true` if the person is authenticated `if(user)....` and we're going to check that using the `onAuthStateChange()` method, so `onAuthStateChange()` just gives us true or false, and whether its true or false no matter we'll set checking or loading to false `setCheckingStatus(false)` which initially was true and in the end we'll return `loggedIn, checkingStatus` and we'll use it inside the `PrivateRoute.jsx` . check the code block above.

h. Inside the `PrivateRoute.jsx` instead of using this dummy data `const loggedIn=false; ` we are going to import the `loggedIn` and `checkingStatus` from our `custom hook` that we created which is `useAuthStatus` like this `const {loggedIn, checkingStatus}=useAuthStatus` . Now if you go to the signin page and login using google and after logging in go to the /profile we cannot see the profile page yet and we are thrown back to the signin page, because we're still not checking the status `const{loggedIn, checkingStatus}=useAuthStatus()` and this is because we're returning the children in `<Outlet />` and the children is not getting the information, and this is because the page is rendering before the information is coming. So we add this code snippet in the return statement, if checkingStatus is true we wanna just return for now we just say `Loading...` and later we'll create the `spinner loading animation` , `return <h3>Loading...</h3>` `if(checkingStatus){return <h3>Loading..</h3>}` so that the code block `return loggedIn ? <Outlet/> : <Navigate to="/sign-in" /> ;` is not returned.
Now if we try the code when we try to navigate in the browser to `/profile` we're still thrown back to the signin page that is because in `PrivateRoute.jsx` in the import we need to put the `useAuthStatus` in curly braces while importing `{useAuthStatus}` because we're returning two things from `useAuthStatus` that is `loggedIn and checkStatus` so we have to go to `useAuthStatus.jsx` remove the `default` in `export default` . Now if you try to login with your google account and go to /profile you can see your credentials like the name and the email address and when you refresh the page you can see the text `Loading...` which we'll convert to a spinner animation. Check below for the code snippet.
```
{
import React from 'react'
import { Outlet, Navigate } from 'react-router';
import {useAuthStatus} from '../hooks/useAuthStatus';

export default function PrivateRoute() {
    const {loggedIn, checkingStatus} = useAuthStatus();
    if (checkingStatus){
        return <h3>Loading...</h3>
    }
    return loggedIn ? <Outlet /> : < Navigate to = "/sign-in" /> ;
}

}
```

i. Now lets add the `signout` functionality , we need to go to `profile.jsx` and inside the `<p>` were we've the text `Sign out` we add an `onClick` event listener `onClick={onLogout}` and we'll create the `onLogout` function at the top. so after the `const {name,email}=formData;` we create the following function
```
{
    function onLogOut(){
        auth.signOut()
        navigate("/")
    }
}
```
//first we need to signout, to do that we have this `auth` this `auth` has a method inside it and its `auth.signOut()` and we need to call it (),  and this is going to signout. And after that we wanna navigate the person to the `homepage` which we can do by using the `useNavigate` hook, put this code `const navigate = useNavigate()` after `const auth = getAuth()` and now we have this ` const navigate` we can use it inside our `onLogOut()` like this `navigate("/")` . Now when you sign in and then try to logout you are taken to the homepage.

j. Now lets add everything to github, `git add .` git add all, `git commit -m "create private route and custom hook for protecting the profile page and add the logout functionality" ` git commit with whatever message, `git push` push the files to the github repository.
